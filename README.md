# GoogleScholar Data Gathering
This simple script has been introduced to query research publications from Google Scholar, specifically designed to assist research students in obtaining relevant scholarly documents. This streamlined system optimizes the search process, empowering students to efficiently retrieve high-quality research publications.

Those who do not have Python (Assuming that some none Program BG people will use this follow the below steps to install Python first). However, note that this has been drafted for Windows OS. 
1. Download the latest version of Python using this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install it.
   2.1 make sure you run it with Admin Privileges,
   2.2 make sure you tick "Add python.exe to PATH"
   2.3 make sure you disable the path length limit
4. unless you are technically sounding, do not use the default installing mode. Else, why you are reading this nonsense :)
5. After you install Python, you can go to the command prompt and check it is working by typing 'python'. (if you wanted to come out you can type exit())
