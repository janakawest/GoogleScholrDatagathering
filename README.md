# GoogleScholar Data Gathering
This simple script has been introduced to query research publications from Google Scholar, specifically designed to assist research students in obtaining relevant scholarly documents. This streamlined system optimizes the search process, empowering students to efficiently retrieve high-quality research publications.

For those who do not have Python (assuming that some non-programmers will use this), follow the steps below to install Python first. However, note that this guide is drafted for Windows OS.

-- Download the latest version of Python using this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Install it.
1. Make sure you run the installer with Admin Privileges.
2. Tick the "Add python.exe to PATH" option.
3. Disable the path length limit.
If you are technically not souding, make sure you use the default installation mode. Otherwise, why are you reading this nonsense? :)
After installing Python, open the command prompt and check if it's working by typing 'python'. (To exit, type 'exit()'.)
----------------------------
-- Download the repository to your PC.
1. Go to the Scholar2 folder.
2. Open a terminal from the Scholar2 folder.

-- Open the Config file.
1. Specify the keywords you want to search in Google Scholar.
2. Specify the number of papers you want to retrieve from Google Scholar.

-- Run the code.
1. Type 'python Scholar2.py'.
2. Execute the Scholar2.py script.

NOTE: Each time you run the script, the Excel file will be overwritten. Either back it up or change the name in Scholar2.py. If you do not have administrative privileges on your PC, it's better to contact the network administrator to enable you to install Python and the necessary libraries.
