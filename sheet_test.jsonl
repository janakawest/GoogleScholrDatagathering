{"title": "Development of a machine learning-based radiomics signature for estimating breast cancer TME phenotypes and predicting anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy response.", "abstract": "Since breast cancer patients respond diversely to immunotherapy, there is an urgent need to explore novel biomarkers to precisely predict clinical responses and enhance therapeutic efficacy. The purpose of our present research was to construct and independently validate a biomarker of tumor microenvironment (TME) phenotypes via a machine learning-based radiomics way. The interrelationship between the biomarker, TME phenotypes and recipients' clinical response was also revealed.\nIn this retrospective multi-cohort investigation, five separate cohorts of breast cancer patients were recruited to measure breast cancer TME phenotypes via a radiomics signature, which was constructed and validated by integrating RNA-seq data with DCE-MRI images for predicting immunotherapy response. Initially, we constructed TME phenotypes using RNA-seq of 1089 breast cancer patients in the TCGA database. Then, parallel DCE-MRI images and RNA-seq of 94 breast cancer patients obtained from TCIA were applied to develop a radiomics-based TME phenotypes signature using random forest in machine learning. The repeatability of the radiomics signature was then validated in an internal validation set. Two additional independent external validation sets were analyzed to reassess this signature. The Immune phenotype cohort (n\u2009=\u2009158) was divided based on CD8 cell infiltration into immune-inflamed and immune-desert phenotypes; these data were utilized to examine the relationship between the immune phenotypes and this signature. Finally, we utilized an Immunotherapy-treated cohort with 77 cases who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment to evaluate the predictive efficiency of this signature in terms of clinical outcomes.\nThe TME phenotypes of breast cancer were separated into two heterogeneous clusters: Cluster A, an \"immune-inflamed\" cluster, containing substantial innate and adaptive immune cell infiltration, and Cluster B, an \"immune-desert\" cluster, with modest TME cell infiltration. We constructed a radiomics signature for the TME phenotypes ([AUC]\u2009=\u20090.855; 95% CI 0.777-0.932; p\u2009<\u20090.05) and verified it in an internal validation set (0.844; 0.606-1; p\u2009<\u20090.05). In the known immune phenotypes cohort, the signature can identify either immune-inflamed or immune-desert tumor (0.814; 0.717-0.911; p\u2009<\u20090.05). In the Immunotherapy-treated cohort, patients with objective response had higher baseline radiomics scores than those with stable or progressing disease (p\u2009<\u20090.05); moreover, the radiomics signature achieved an AUC of 0.784 (0.643-0.926; p\u2009<\u20090.05) for predicting immunotherapy response.\nOur imaging biomarker, a practicable radiomics signature, is beneficial for predicting the TME phenotypes and clinical response in anti-PD-1/PD-L1-treated breast cancer patients. It is particularly effective in identifying the \"immune-desert\" phenotype and may aid in its transformation into an \"immune-inflamed\" phenotype.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2024-01-30", "authors": ["XiaoruiHan", "YuanGuo", "HuifenYe", "ZhihongChen", "QingruHu", "XinhuaWei", "ZaiyiLiu", "ChanghongLiang"], "doi": "10.1186/s13058-024-01776-y"}
{"title": "TBACkp: HER2 expression status classification network focusing on intrinsic subenvironmental characteristics of breast cancer liver metastases.", "abstract": "The HER2 expression status in breast cancer liver metastases is a crucial indicator for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis assessment of patients. And typical diagnosis involves assessing the HER2 expression status through invasive procedures like biopsy. However, this method has certain drawbacks, such as being difficult in obtaining tissue samples and requiring long examination periods. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-aided diagnostic model. This model enables rapid diagnosis. It diagnoses a patient's HER2 expression status on the basis of preprocessed images, which is the region of the lesion extracted from a CT image rather than from an actual tissue sample. The algorithm of the model adopts a parallel structure, including a Branch Block and a Trunk Block. The Branch Block is responsible for extracting the gradient characteristics between the tumor sub-environments, and the Trunk Block is for fusing the characteristics extracted by the Branch Block. The Branch Block contains CNN with self-attention, which combines the advantages of CNN and self-attention to extract more meticulous and comprehensive image features. And the Trunk Block is so designed that it fuses the extracted image feature information without affecting the transmission of the original image features. The Conv-Attention is used to calculate the attention in the Trunk Block, which uses kernel dot product and is responsible for providing the weight for the self-attention in the process of using convolution induced deviation calculation. Combined with the structure of the model and the method used, we refer to this model as TBACkp. The dataset comprises the enhanced abdominal CT images of 151 patients with liver metastases from breast cancer, together with the corresponding HER2 expression levels for each patient. The experimental results are as follows: (AUC: 0.915, ACC: 0.854, specificity: 0.809, precision: 0.863, recall: 0.881, F1-score: 0.872). The results demonstrate that this method can accurately assess the HER2 expression status in patients when compared with other advanced deep learning model.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2024-01-27", "authors": ["KunYang", "JieSong", "MengLiu", "LinyanXue", "ShuangLiu", "XiaopingYin", "KunLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108002"}

{"title": "Empowering breast cancer diagnosis and radiology practice: advances in artificial intelligence for contrast-enhanced mammography.", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in breast imaging span a wide range of tasks including decision support, risk assessment, patient management, quality assessment, treatment response assessment and image enhancement. However, their integration into the clinical workflow has been slow due to the lack of a consensus on data quality, benchmarked robust implementation, and consensus-based guidelines to ensure standardization and generalization. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has improved sensitivity and specificity compared to current standards of breast cancer diagnostic imaging i.e., mammography (MG) and/or conventional ultrasound (US), with comparable accuracy to MRI (current diagnostic imaging benchmark), but at a much lower cost and higher throughput. This makes CEM an excellent tool for widespread breast lesion characterization for all women, including underserved and minority women. Underlining the critical need for early detection and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer, this review examines the limitations of conventional approaches and reveals how AI can help overcome them. The Methodical approaches, such as image processing, feature extraction, quantitative analysis, lesion classification, lesion segmentation, integration with clinical data, early detection, and screening support have been carefully analysed in recent studies addressing breast cancer detection and diagnosis.

We present the Deep Learning On-Demand Assistant (DL-ODA), a fully automated, end-to-end clinical platform that enables AI interventions for any disease site featuring an automated model-training pipeline, auto-segmentations, and QA reporting.\nWe developed, tested, and prospectively deployed the DL-ODA system at a large university affiliated hospital center. Medical professionals activate the DL-ODA via two pathways (1): On-Demand, used for immediate AI decision support for a patient-specific treatment plan, and (2) Ambient, in which QA is provided for all daily radiotherapy (RT) plans by comparing DL segmentations with manual delineations and calculating the dosimetric impact. To demonstrate the implementation of a new anatomy segmentation, we used the model-training pipeline to generate a breast segmentation model based on a large clinical dataset. Additionally, the contour QA functionality of existing models was assessed using a retrospective cohort of 3,399 lung and 885 spine RT cases. Ambient QA was performed for various disease sites including spine RT and heart for dosimetric sparing.\nSuccessful training of the breast model was completed in less than a day and resulted in clinically viable whole breast contours. For the retrospective analysis, we evaluated manual-versus-AI similarity for the ten most common structures. The DL-ODA detected high similarities in heart, lung, liver, and kidney delineations but lower for esophagus, trachea, stomach, and small bowel due largely to incomplete manual contouring. The deployed Ambient QAs for heart and spine sites have prospectively processed over 2,500 cases and 230 cases over 9 months and 5 months, respectively, automatically alerting the RT personnel.\nThe DL-ODA capabilities in providing universal AI interventions were demonstrated for On-Demand contour QA, DL segmentations, and automated model training, and confirmed successful integration of the system into a large academic radiotherapy department.

A report of the International Immuno-oncology Biomarker Working Group on Breast Cancer.", "abstract": "Recent advances in the field of immuno-oncology have brought transformative changes in the management of cancer patients. The immune profile of tumours has been found to have key value in predicting disease prognosis and treatment response in various cancers. Multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence have emerged as potent tools for the simultaneous detection of multiple protein biomarkers in a single tissue section, thereby expanding opportunities for molecular and immune profiling while preserving tissue samples. By establishing the phenotype of individual tumour cells when distributed within a mixed cell population, the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers with high-throughput multiplex immunophenotyping of tumour samples has great potential to guide appropriate treatment choices. Moreover, the emergence of novel multi-marker imaging approaches can now provide unprecedented insights into the tumour microenvironment, including the potential interplay between various cell types. However, there are significant challenges to widespread integration of these technologies in daily research and clinical practice. This review addresses the challenges and potential solutions within a structured framework of action from a regulatory and clinical trial perspective.

{"title": "Automated three-dimensional image registration for longitudinal photoacoustic imaging.", "abstract": "Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has great potential in monitoring disease progression and treatment response in breast cancer. However, due to variations in breast repositioning, there is a chance of geometric misalignment between images. Further, poor repositioning can affect light fluence distribution and imaging field-of-view, making images different from one another. The net effect is that it becomes challenging to distinguish between image changes due to repositioning effects and those due to true biological variations.\nThe aim is to develop a three-dimensional image registration framework for geometrically aligning repeated PAT volumetric images, which are potentially affected by repositioning effects such as misalignment, changed radiant exposure conditions, and different fields-of-view.\nThe proposed framework involves the use of a coordinate-based neural network to represent the displacement field between pairs of PAT volumetric images. A loss function based on normalized cross correlation and Frangi vesselness feature extraction at multiple scales was implemented. We refer to our image registration framework as MUVINN-reg, which stands for multiscale vesselness-based image registration using neural networks. The approach was tested on a longitudinal dataset of healthy volunteer breast PAT images acquired with the hybrid photoacoustic-ultrasound Photoacoustic Mammoscope 3 imaging system.

{"title": "SwinHR: Hemodynamic-powered hierarchical vision transformer for breast tumor segmentation.", "abstract": "Accurate and automated segmentation of breast tumors in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a critical role in computer-aided diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. However, this task is challenging, due to random variation in tumor sizes, shapes, appearances, and blurred boundaries of tumors caused by inherent heterogeneity of breast cancer. Moreover, the presence of ill-posed artifacts in DCE-MRI further complicate the process of tumor region annotation. To address the challenges above, we propose a scheme (named SwinHR) integrating prior DCE-MRI knowledge and temporal-spatial information of breast tumors. The prior DCE-MRI knowledge refers to hemodynamic information extracted from multiple DCE-MRI phases, which can provide pharmacokinetics information to describe metabolic changes of the tumor cells over the scanning time. The Swin Transformer with hierarchical re-parameterization large kernel architecture (H-RLK) can capture long-range dependencies within DCE-MRI while maintaining computational efficiency by a shifted window-based self-attention mechanism. The use of H-RLK can extract high-level features with a wider receptive field, which can make the model capture contextual information at different levels of abstraction. Extensive experiments are conducted in large-scale datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed SwinHR scheme, demonstrating its superiority over recent state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Also, a subgroup analysis split by MRI scanners, field strength, and tumor size is conducted to verify its generalization.

{"title": "Revolutionizing Breast Healthcare: Harnessing the Role of Artificial Intelligence.", "abstract": "Breast cancer has the highest incidence and second-highest mortality rate among all cancers. The management of breast cancer is being revolutionized by artificial intelligence (AI), which is improving early detection, pathological diagnosis, risk assessment, individualized treatment recommendations, and treatment response prediction. Nuclear medicine has used artificial intelligence (AI) for over 50 years, but more recent advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have given AI in nuclear medicine additional capabilities. AI accurately analyzes breast imaging scans for early detection, minimizing false negatives while offering radiologists reliable, swift image processing assistance. It smoothly fits into radiology workflows, which may result in early treatments and reduced expenditures. In pathological diagnosis, artificial intelligence improves the quality of diagnostic data by ensuring accurate diagnoses, lowering inter-observer variability, speeding up the review process, and identifying errors or poor slides. By taking into consideration nutritional, genetic, and environmental factors, providing individualized risk assessments, and recommending more regular tests for higher-risk patients, AI aids with the risk assessment of breast\u00a0cancer. The integration of clinical and genetic data into individualized treatment recommendations by AI facilitates collaborative decision-making and resource allocation optimization while also enabling patient progress monitoring, drug interaction consideration, and alignment with clinical guidelines. AI is used to analyze patient data, imaging, genomic data, and pathology reports in order to forecast how a treatment would respond. These models anticipate treatment outcomes, make sure that clinical recommendations are followed, and learn from historical data. The implementation of AI in medicine is hampered by issues with data quality, integration with healthcare IT systems, data protection, bias reduction, and ethical considerations, necessitating transparency and constant surveillance. Protecting patient privacy, resolving biases, maintaining transparency, identifying fault for mistakes, and ensuring fair access are just a few examples of ethical considerations. To preserve patient trust and address the effect on the healthcare workforce, ethical frameworks must be developed. The amazing potential of AI in the treatment of breast cancer calls for careful examination of its ethical and practical implications.

{"title": "Breast Multiparametric MRI for Prediction of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Breast Cancer: The BMMR2 Challenge.", "abstract": "Purpose To describe the design, conduct, and results of the Breast Multiparametric MRI for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Response (BMMR2) challenge. Materials and Methods The BMMR2 computational challenge opened on May 28, 2021, and closed on December 21, 2021. The goal of the challenge was to identify image-based markers derived from multiparametric breast MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, along with clinical data for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant treatment. Data included 573 breast MRI studies from 191 women (mean age [\u00b1SD], 48.9 years \u00b1 10.56) in the I-SPY 2/American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6698 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01042379). The challenge cohort was split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets, with teams blinded to test set pCR outcomes. Prediction performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with the benchmark established from the ACRIN 6698 primary analysis. Results Eight teams submitted final predictions. Entries from three teams had point estimators of AUC that were higher than the benchmark performance (AUC, 0.782 [95% CI: 0.670, 0.893], with AUCs of 0.803 [95% CI: 0.702, 0.904], 0.838 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.928], and 0.840 [95% CI: 0.748, 0.932]). A variety of approaches were used, ranging from extraction of individual features to deep learning and artificial intelligence methods, incorporating DCE and DWI alone or in combination.

Because DCIS is treated as early breast cancer, many women with harmless DCIS face overtreatment. To identify these women that may forego treatment, we hypothesized that DCIS morphometric features relate to the risk of subsequent iIBC. We developed an artificial intelligence-based DCIS morphometric analysis pipeline (AIDmap) to detect DCIS as a pathologist and measure morphological structures in hematoxylin-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. These were from a case-control study of patients diagnosed with primary DCIS, treated by breast-conserving surgery without radiotherapy. We analyzed 689 WSIs of DCIS of which 226 were diagnosed with subsequent iIBC (cases) and 463 were not (controls). The distribution of 15 duct morphological measurements in each H&E was summarized in 55 morphometric variables. A ridge regression classifier with cross validation predicted 5-years-free of iIBC with an area-under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.76). A morphometric signature based on the 30 variables most associated with outcome, identified lesions containing small-sized ducts, low number of cells and low DCIS/stroma area ratio. This signature was associated with lower iIBC risk in a multivariate regression model including grade, ER, HER2 and COX-2 expression (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.28-0.78).

{"title": "Ultrafast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI of the Breast: From Theory to Practice.", "abstract": "The development of ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced (UF-DCE) MRI has occurred in tandem with fast MRI scan techniques, particularly view-sharing and compressed sensing. Understanding the strengths of each technique and optimizing the relevant parameters are essential to their implementation. UF-DCE MRI has now shifted from research protocols to becoming a part of clinical scan protocols for breast cancer. UF-DCE MRI is expected to compensate for the low specificity of abbreviated MRI by adding kinetic information from the upslope of the time-intensity curve. Because kinetic information from UF-DCE MRI is obtained from the shape and timing of the initial upslope, various new kinetic parameters have been proposed. These parameters may be associated with receptor status or prognostic markers for breast cancer. In addition to the diagnosis of malignant lesions, more emphasis has been placed on predicting and evaluating treatment response because hyper-vascularity is linked to the aggressiveness of breast cancers. In clinical practice, it is important to note that breast lesion images obtained from UF-DCE MRI are slightly different from those obtained by conventional DCE MRI in terms of morphology. A major benefit of using UF-DCE MRI is avoidance of the marked or moderate background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) that can obscure the target enhancing lesions. BPE is less prominent in the earlier phases of UF-DCE MRI, which offers better lesion-to-noise contrast. The excellent contrast of early-enhancing vessels provides a key to understanding the detailed pathological structure of tumor-associated vessels. UF-DCE MRI is normally accompanied by a large volume of image data for which automated/artificial intelligence-based processing is expected to be useful. In this review, both the theoretical and practical aspects of UF-DCE MRI are summarized.

{"title": "Radiation Dose Reduction in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis by MTANN with Multi-scale Kernels.", "abstract": "Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an advanced three-dimensional screening modality for the early detection of breast cancer. DBT is able to reduce the problem of tissue overlap in standard two-dimensional mammograms, thus improving the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection. Although DBT can improve diagnostic accuracy, it leads to higher radiation dose to patients compared to two-dimensional mammography. In this paper, we propose a novel radiation dose reduction technique that introduces multi-scale kernels to our original massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) to reduce radiation dose substantially, while maintaining high image quality in DBT. After training our new MTANN with low-dose (LD) images and the corresponding \"teaching\" high-dose (HD) images, we can convert new LD images to \"virtual\" high-dose (VHD) images where noise and artifact in the LD images are significantly reduced. In VHD images, it is critical to preserve subtle structures and tiny patterns such as microcalcifications (MCs) which are essential for breast cancer diagnosis. We developed anatomical MTANN experts including an MC-specific expert with multi-scale kernels, which are combined by gating layers to generate whole VHD images. Our MTANN scheme was able to achieve a 79% dose reduction while preserving details of MCs. Experimental results demonstrated that our method achieved the highest performance among the best-known noise-reduction techniques and state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques.Clinical Relevance- Our method can decrease the dose radiation dose in DBT and maintain the image quality.", "journal": "Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Diagnostic imaging plays a pivotal role in breast cancer diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation. Radiomics is an emerging field of study in medical imaging that contains a broad set of computational methods to extract quantitative features from radiographic images. This can be utilized to guide diagnosis, treatment response, and prognosis in clinical settings.\u00a0 A systematic review was performed in concordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy. Quality was assessed using the radiomics quality score. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of radiomics analysis, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were included for meta-analysis. The area under the curve analysis was recorded. An extensive statistical analysis was performed following the Cochrane guidelines. Statistical significance was determined if p-values were less than 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager (RevMan), Version 5.4.1. A total of 31 manuscripts involving 8,773 patients were included, with 17 contributing to the meta-analysis. The cohort comprised 56.2% malignant breast cancers and 43.8% benign breast lesions. MRI demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89-0.92) and a specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86) in differentiating between benign and malignant breast cancers. Mammography-based radiomic features predicted breast cancer subtype with a sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76-0.82) and a specificity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79-0.84). Ultrasound-based analysis yielded a sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94) and a specificity of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.88).

The results underscore the potential of radiomic assessment as a minimally invasive alternative or adjunctive diagnostic tool for breast cancer.

All had undergone breast surgery for different indications (right/left, lumpectomy/mastectomy) and were evenly divided between these four cases, with five extended cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans per patient. The dataset was used in an Ethos emulator to test the full adaptive workflow. The contours generated by artificial intelligence (AI) for the influencers (left and right breasts and lungs, heart) and elastic or rigid propagation for the target volumes (internal mammary chain (IMC) and clavicular lymph nodes (CLNs)) were compared to the initial contours delineated by the physician using two metrics: Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and Hausdorff 95% distance (HD95). The repeatability of influencer generation was investigated. The times taken by the emulator to generate contours, optimize plans, and calculate doses were recorded. The quality of the scheduled and adapted plans generated by Ethos was assessed using planning target volume (PTV) coverage, homogeneity indices (HIs), and doses to organs at risk (OARs) via dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. Quality assurance (QA) of the treatment plans was performed using an independent portal dosimetry tool (EpiQA) and gamma index.\nOn average, the DICE for the influencers was greater than 0.9. Contours resulting from rigid propagation had a higher DICE and a lower HD95 than those resulting from elastic deformation but remained below the values obtained for the influencers: DICE values were 0.79 \u00b1 0.11 and 0.46 \u00b1 0.17 for the CLN and IMC, respectively. Regarding the repeatability of the influencer segmentation, the DICE was close to 1, and the mean HD95 was strictly less than 0.15\u00a0mm.

Biological heterogeneity in recurrent tumors contributes to the different risks of PRNN. Radiomics can be used to mine high-throughput non-invasive image features to predict clinical outcomes and capture underlying biological functions. We aimed to develop a radiogenomic signature for the pre-treatment prediction of PRNN to guide re-radiotherapy in patients with LRNPC.\nThis multicenter study included 761 re-irradiated patients with LRNPC at four centers in NPC endemic area and divided them into training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts. We built a machine learning (random forest) radiomic signature based on the pre-treatment multiparametric magnetic resonance images for predicting PRNN following re-radiotherapy. We comprehensively assessed the performance of the radiomic signature. Transcriptomic sequencing and gene set enrichment analyses were conducted to identify the associated biological processes.\nThe radiomic signature showed discrimination of 1-year PRNN in the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts (area under the curve (AUC) 0.713-0.756). Stratified by a cutoff score of 0.735, patients with high-risk signature had higher incidences of PRNN than patients with low-risk signature (1-year PRNN rates 42.2-62.5% vs. 16.3-18.8%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The signature significantly outperformed the clinical model (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and was generalizable across different centers, imaging parameters, and patient subgroups. The radiomic signature had prognostic value concerning its correlation with PRNN-related deaths (hazard ratio (HR) 3.07-6.75, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and all causes of deaths (HR 1.53-2.30, P\u2009<\u20090.01). Radiogenomics analyses revealed associations between the radiomic signature and signaling pathways involved in tissue fibrosis and vascularity.\nWe present a radiomic signature for the individualized risk assessment of PRNN following re-radiotherapy, which may serve as a noninvasive radio-biomarker of radiation injury-associated processes and a useful clinical tool to personalize treatment recommendations for patients with LANPC.", "journal": "BMC medicine", "date": "2023-11-28", "authors": ["TingLiu", "DiDong", "XunZhao", "Xiao-MinOu", "Jun-LinYi", "JianGuan", "YeZhang", "LvXiao-Fei", "Chuan-MiaoXie", "Dong-HuaLuo", "RuiSun", "Qiu-YanChen", "LvXing", "Shan-ShanGuo", "Li-TingLiu", "Da-FengLin", "Yan-ZhouChen", "Jie-YiLin", "Mei-JuanLuo", "Wen-BinYan", "Mei-LinHe", "Meng-YuanMao", "Man-YiZhu", "Wen-HuiChen", "Bo-WenShen", "Shi-QianWang", "Hai-LinLi", "Lian-ZhenZhong", "Chao-SuHu", "De-HuaWu", "Hai-QiangMai", "JieTian", "Lin-QuanTang"], "doi": "10.1186/s12916-023-03164-3\n10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30956-0\n10.1200/JCO.2015.60.9347\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2019.101890\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.01.041\n10.1002/hed.24993\n10.1200/JCO.2017.75.5165\n10.1016/j.oraloncology.2017.02.012\n10.2147/CMAR.S180164\n10.5732/cjc.012.10252\n10.1186/s40880-016-0124-0\n10.1016/j.oraloncology.2019.08.017\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-2910\n10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.036\n10.3322/caac.21552\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.04.003\n10.1186/s12916-019-1422-6\n10.1148/radiol.2017161845\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141\n10.2147/CMAR.S197841\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0339\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1038/nature08460\n10.3389/fonc.2020.01708\n10.6004/jnccn.2020.0031\n10.1186/s12885-016-2803-2\n10.1038/s41591-021-01444-0\n10.1016/j.radonc.2004.08.021\n10.1016/0030-4220(87)90136-8\n10.1016/S0360-3016(01)01593-0\n10.1038/s41392-021-00729-7\n10.1038/s41587-020-00776-5"}
{"title": "Cancer care pathways across seven countries in Europe: What are the current obstacles? And how can artificial intelligence help?", "abstract": "Cancer poses significant challenges for healthcare professionals across the disease pathway including cancer imaging. This study constitutes part of the user requirement definition of INCISIVE EU project. The project has been designed to explore the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in cancer imaging to streamline diagnosis and management. The study aimed to map cancer care pathways (breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers) across INCISIVE partner countries, and identify bottle necks within these pathways.\nEmail interviews were conducted with ten oncology specialised healthcare professionals representing INCISIVE partner countries: Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Finland, the United Kingdom (UK) and Serbia. A purposive sampling strategy was employed for recruitment and data was collected between December 2020 and April 2021. Data was entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to allow content examination and comparative analysis.\nThe analysed pathways all shared a common characteristic: inequalities in relation to delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment. All the studied countries, except the UK, lacked official national data about diagnostic and therapeutic delays. Furthermore, a considerable variation was noted regarding the availability of imaging and diagnostic services across the seven countries. Several concerns were also noted for inefficiencies/inequalities with regards to national screening for the four investigated cancer types.\nDelays in cancer diagnosis and treatment are an ongoing challenge and a source for inequalities. It is important to have systematic reporting of diagnostic and therapeutic delays in all countries to allow the proper estimation of its magnitude and support needed to address it. Our findings also support the orientation of the current policies towards early detection and wide scale adoption and implementation of cancer screening, through research, innovation, and technology. Technologies involving AI can have a great potential to revolutionise cancer care delivery.\nThis study highlights the widespread delay in cancer diagnosis across Europe and supports the need for, systematic reporting of delays, improved availability of imaging services, and optimised national screening programs. The goal is to enhance cancer care delivery, encourage early detection, and implement research, innovation, and AI-based technologies for improved cancer imaging.", "journal": "Journal of cancer policy", "date": "2023-11-27", "authors": ["ImanHesso", "ReemKayyali", "LithinZacharias", "AndreasCharalambous", "MariaLavdaniti", "EvangeliaStalika", "TarekAjami", "WandaAcampa", "JasminaBoban", "Shereen NabhaniGebara"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jcpo.2023.100457"}
{"title": "Imaging-proteomic analysis for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy responses in patients with breast cancer.", "abstract": "Optimizing patient selection for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer remains an unmet clinical need. Quantitative features from medical imaging were reported to be predictive of treatment responses. However, the biologic meaning of these latent features is poorly understood, preventing the clinical use of such noninvasive imaging markers. The study aimed to develop a deep learning signature (DLS) from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer and to further investigate the biologic meaning of the DLS by identifying its underlying pathways using paired MRI and proteomic sequencing data.\nMRI-based DLS was constructed (radiogenomic training dataset, n\u2009=\u2009105) and validated (radiogenomic validation dataset, n\u2009=\u200926) for the prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Proteomic sequencing revealed biological functions facilitating pCR (n\u2009=\u2009139). Their associations with DLS were uncovered by radiogenomic analysis.\nThe DLS achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.923 with an AUC of 0.958, higher than the performance of the model trained by transfer learning. Cellular membrane formation, endocytosis, insulin-like growth factor binding, protein localization to membranes, and cytoskeleton-dependent trafficking were differentially regulated in patients showing pCR. Oncogenic signaling pathways, features correlated with human phenotypes, and features correlated with general biological processes were significantly correlated with DLS in both training and validation dataset (p.adj\u2009<\u20090.05).\nOur study offers a biologically interpretable DLS for the prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer, which may guide personalized medication.", "journal": "Cancer medicine", "date": "2023-11-14", "authors": ["JingxianDuan", "YuanshenZhao", "QiuchangSun", "DongLiang", "ZaiyiLiu", "XinChen", "Zhi-ChengLi"], "doi": "10.1002/cam4.6704\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.6004/jnccn.2022.0030\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2022.102375\n10.1056/NEJMoa1814017\n10.1016/j.cct.2018.06.016\n10.1016/j.ejso.2019.08.001\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aan0026\n10.1002/onco.13546\n10.1007/s10549-009-0333-1\n10.1093/annonc/mdu112\n10.1016/j.eururo.2015.07.009\n10.3390/cells9071643\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1045\n10.3390/ijms231810901\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3190\n10.3390/cancers13102447\n10.1007/s00330-020-06968-6\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0339\n10.1148/radiol.2021203281\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103583\n10.1007/s00330-022-09066-x\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.016\n10.1093/bib/bbw114\n10.6004/jnccn.2018.0083\n10.1074/mcp.M114.044305\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100141\n10.1093/nar/gkaa1074\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1186/1471-2105-14-7\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3492\n10.1038/s41598-021-04032-x\n10.3389/fonc.2022.909426\n10.3390/cancers14041087\n10.1007/s00259-021-05489-8\n10.1148/radiol.211509\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-1329\n10.1109/TMI.2021.3051416\n10.1109/TMI.2022.3231461\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1305\n10.1371/journal.pone.0100738"}
{"title": "Exploring Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, Predictive Models, Radiomic, and Pathological Markers in Breast Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.", "abstract": "Breast cancer retains its position as the most prevalent form of malignancy among females on a global scale. The careful selection of appropriate treatment for each patient holds paramount importance in effectively managing breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) plays a pivotal role in the comprehensive treatment of this disease. Administering chemotherapy before surgery, NACT becomes a powerful tool in reducing tumor size, potentially enabling fewer invasive surgical procedures and even rendering initially inoperable tumors amenable to surgery. However, a significant challenge lies in the varying responses exhibited by different patients towards NACT. To address this challenge, researchers have focused on developing prediction models that can identify those who would benefit from NACT and those who would not. Such models have the potential to reduce treatment costs and contribute to a more efficient and accurate management of breast cancer. Therefore, this review has two objectives: first, to identify the most effective radiomic markers correlated with NACT response, and second, to explore whether integrating radiomic markers extracted from radiological images with pathological markers can enhance the predictive accuracy of NACT response. This review will delve into addressing these research questions and also shed light on the emerging research direction of leveraging artificial intelligence techniques for predicting NACT response, thereby shaping the future landscape of breast cancer treatment.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2023-11-14", "authors": ["BasmaElsayed", "AhmedAlksas", "MohamedShehata", "AliMahmoud", "MonaZaky", "RehamAlghandour", "KhaledAbdelwahab", "MohamedAbdelkhalek", "MohammedGhazal", "SohailContractor", "HossamEl-Din Moustafa", "AymanEl-Baz"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers15215288\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.3322/caac.21763\n10.1046/j.1524-4741.9.s2.5.x\n10.4137/BCBCR.S29420\n10.1093/jjco/hyz213\n10.1001/jama.2018.19323\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2022.102375\n10.1200/JCO.20.03399\n10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001332\n10.1016/j.breast.2014.06.004\n10.1634/theoncologist.8-6-521\n10.1038/s41598-022-06100-2\n10.1016/j.tranon.2019.05.004\n10.1186/s12957-023-03178-4\n10.1200/EDBK_390464\n10.1016/j.ejca.2023.03.042\n10.1186/s12885-021-08997-w\n10.1016/j.prp.2021.153753\n10.3390/curroncol29070389\n10.3389/fphar.2018.00245\n10.1007/s10549-020-06093-4\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2022.110561\n10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2022.100883\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2022.110247\n10.1016/j.soncn.2017.02.009\n10.1186/s43055-020-00175-5\n10.1007/s00330-021-08306-w\n10.1016/j.acra.2016.08.019\n10.1053/j.sult.2017.08.005\n10.1007/s00330-015-3807-z\n10.1177/0284185117735561\n10.1186/s40064-016-2385-0\n10.1016/j.diii.2016.08.013\n10.21037/qims.2019.10.13\n10.1038/s41598-021-85353-9\n10.3389/fonc.2021.605230\n10.1007/s00330-021-08414-7\n10.18632/oncotarget.1950\n10.1088/1361-6560/ac8c82\n10.1016/j.ejca.2021.01.028\n10.1016/j.tranon.2014.10.007\n10.18632/oncotarget.8862\n10.1016/j.tranon.2019.06.004\n10.1002/cam4.3255\n10.18632/oncotarget.27742\n10.1038/srep45733\n10.1371/journal.pone.0189634\n10.18632/oncotarget.26996\n10.1007/s13244-018-0642-1\n10.1016/j.ejca.2016.09.031\n10.1186/s13058-021-01429-4\n10.1109/JBHI.2020.3008040\n10.3389/fonc.2022.812463\n10.1016/j.eclinm.2022.101562\n10.1007/s00330-021-08293-y\n10.3389/fonc.2022.748008\n10.1186/s12885-021-08649-z\n10.3390/cancers13143521\n10.3389/fonc.2020.01301\n10.1007/s40336-013-0014-2\n10.1102/1470-7330.2003.0032\n10.1007/s12094-014-1168-8\n10.2214/AJR.19.21635\n10.1016/j.ejso.2013.08.025\n10.2214/AJR.15.15590\n10.1186/s13550-016-0177-8\n10.2967/jnumed.111.093443\n10.2967/jnumed.117.189894\n10.1258/ar.2012.110699\n10.1007/s00259-013-2515-7\n10.1038/bjc.2013.469\n10.1016/j.ejca.2014.04.020\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0384\n10.1097/MD.0000000000002914\n10.1007/s12149-017-1184-1\n10.1007/s00259-019-04313-8\n10.1007/s00259-020-04684-3\n10.3389/fonc.2021.601053\n10.1007/s00259-015-2995-8\n10.1007/s40846-016-0163-7\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.12.015\n10.1002/jmri.23971\n10.1002/nbm.3132\n10.1259/bjr.20170269\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.06.019\n10.1007/s10549-018-4990-9\n10.2214/AJR.16.17125\n10.1038/s41523-020-00203-7\n10.1002/mrm.24782\n10.1016/j.tranon.2015.11.016\n10.1007/s00330-015-3948-0\n10.18383/j.tom.2016.00241\n10.1038/s41598-018-27764-9\n10.1016/j.tranon.2015.03.005\n10.1186/s13058-017-0846-1\n10.1002/jmri.28273\n10.1117/1.JMI.6.3.034502\n10.18383/j.tom.2018.00046\n10.1002/jmri.25279\n10.1007/s11548-018-1790-y\n10.1007/s11548-020-02209-9\n10.1016/j.measurement.2022.112269\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2022.110220\n10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001460\n10.1038/s41598-019-48465-x\n10.1186/s13058-020-01291-w\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.622219\n10.1186/s12938-021-00899-z\n10.1148/radiol.14131332\n10.1002/jmri.26996\n10.1038/s41598-021-93592-z\n10.3389/fonc.2022.846775\n10.1007/s00330-021-08291-0\n10.1186/s12885-022-10315-x\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000100\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2016.02.006\n10.1016/j.acra.2021.01.023\n10.1259/bjr.20200287\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000518\n10.1148/radiol.2019182718\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3190\n10.1371/journal.pone.0280320\n10.3389/fonc.2020.01410\n10.1097/RCT.0000000000000978\n10.1007/s12094-019-02109-8\n10.1038/s41598-021-98408-8\n10.1111/tbj.13032\n10.3390/cancers14071727\n10.1038/s41598-020-77875-5\n10.3389/fonc.2021.630780"}
{"title": "A Pictorial Exploration of Mammary Paget Disease: Insights and Perspectives.", "abstract": "Mammary Paget disease (MPD) is a rare condition primarily affecting adult women, characterized by unilateral skin changes in the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) and frequently associated with underlying breast carcinoma. Histologically, MPD is identified by large intraepidermal epithelial cells (Paget cells) with distinct characteristics. Immunohistochemical profiles aid in distinguishing MPD from other skin conditions. Clinical evaluation and imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are recommended if MPD is suspected, although definitive diagnosis always requires histological examination. This review delves into the historical context, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of MPD, emphasizing the need for early detection. The classification of MPD based on pathogenesis is explored, shedding light on its varied presentations. Treatment options, including mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery, are discussed with clear guidelines for different scenarios. Adjuvant therapies are considered, particularly in cases with underlying breast cancer. Prognostic factors are outlined, underlining the importance of early intervention. Looking to the future, emerging techniques, like liquid biopsy, new immunohistochemical and molecular markers, and artificial intelligence-based image analysis, hold the potential to transform MPD diagnosis and treatment. These innovations offer hope for early detection and improved patient care, though validation through large-scale clinical trials is needed.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2023-11-14", "authors": ["LucianoMariano", "LucaNicosia", "DavidePupo", "Antonia MariaOlivieri", "SofiaScolari", "FilippoPesapane", "AntuonoLatronico", "Anna CarlaBozzini", "NicolaFusco", "Marta CruzBlanco", "GiovanniMazzarol", "GiovanniCorso", "Viviana EnricaGalimberti", "MassimoVenturini", "MariaPizzamiglio", "EnricoCassano"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers15215276\n10.1002/1097-0142(197009)26:3<680::AID-CNCR2820260329>3.0.CO;2-P\n10.1016/S1072-7515(98)00143-4\n10.1007/s10549-007-9880-5\n10.1177/2050313X231151753\n10.1007/s10549-006-9329-2\n10.1259/bjr/94607773\n10.1007/s00404-006-0160-0\n10.1093/jjco/hyi044\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2006.06.010\n10.4103/0019-5154.39736\n10.1001/archdermatol.2008.508\n10.1002/cncr.22137\n10.1148/rg.317115070\n10.1097/00000372-198908000-00004\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2010.03665.x\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.1989.tb01610.x\n10.1097/00129039-200306000-00005\n10.4103/1477-3163.90676\n10.1007/s00428-001-0581-x\n10.1002/1097-0142(19840801)54:3<545::AID-CNCR2820540327>3.0.CO;2-M\n10.1016/S0046-8177(03)00405-2\n10.1097/01.rli.0000163742.40401.4e\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2007.07.046\n10.1097/00000372-199510000-00010\n10.1007/s004280050167\n10.1111/his.14091\n10.1016/S0344-0338(11)80085-3\n10.1111/cup.14414\n10.1245/s10434-012-2226-5\n10.1111/j.1365-2230.2006.02326.x\n10.1016/j.breast.2003.11.005\n10.1016/j.breast.2007.11.007\n10.1002/cncr.11337\n10.1007/BF01807702\n10.1053/ctrv.2000.0203\n10.1097/00000658-197006010-00007\n10.1148/radiology.189.1.8396786\n10.1007/s10549-013-2661-4\n10.2340/00015555924447\n10.1002/cncr.29687\n10.1002/cncr.10638\n10.1148/rg.292085128\n10.1016/S0009-9260(97)80081-5\n10.1007/s00404-009-1244-4\n10.1590/S1807-59322009000600018\n10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181fd1eec\n10.12968/hmed.2022.0439\n10.1159/000368431\n10.1002/1097-0142(20010201)91:3<472::AID-CNCR1024>3.0.CO;2-Q\n10.1002/bjs.9863\n10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000741\n10.1200/JCO.22.02900\n10.5858/2003-127-36-MVFB\n10.1177/030089167606200507\n10.1111/j.1468-3083.2007.02154.x\n10.3390/ijms24032505\n10.1186/s12943-022-01543-7\n10.1007/s10549-022-06637-w\n10.3390/medicina59010086\n10.3390/diagnostics13122041\n10.1109/TMI.2019.2945514\n10.1148/radiol.2019182716\n10.1148/ryai.210199\n10.1007/s00330-021-08306-w\n10.3390/medicina59091544\n10.3389/fonc.2021.810909"}
{"title": "Impact of Imaging Biomarkers and AI on Breast Cancer Management: A Brief Review.", "abstract": "Breast cancer stands out as the most frequently identified malignancy, ranking as the fifth leading cause of global cancer-related deaths. The American College of Radiology (ACR) introduced the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as a standard terminology facilitating communication between radiologists and clinicians; however, an update is now imperative to encompass the latest imaging modalities developed subsequent to the 5th edition of BI-RADS. Within this review article, we provide a concise history of BI-RADS, delve into advanced mammography techniques, ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET/CT images, and microwave breast imaging, and subsequently furnish comprehensive, updated insights into Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI), diagnostic imaging biomarkers, and the assessment of treatment responses. This endeavor aims to enhance radiologists' proficiency in catering to the personalized needs of breast cancer patients. Lastly, we explore the augmented benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) applications in segmenting, detecting, and diagnosing breast cancer, as well as the early prediction of the response of tumors to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). By assimilating state-of-the-art computer algorithms capable of deciphering intricate imaging data and aiding radiologists in rendering precise and effective diagnoses, AI has profoundly revolutionized the landscape of breast cancer radiology. Its vast potential holds the promise of bolstering radiologists' capabilities and ameliorating patient outcomes in the realm of breast cancer management.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2023-11-14",

{"title": "Correlation between AI-based CT organ features and normal lung dose in adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery: a multicenter prospective study.", "abstract": "Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is one of the common side effects after adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer. Irradiation dose to normal lung was related to RP. We aimed to propose an organ features based on deep learning (DL) model and to evaluate the correlation between normal lung dose and organ features.\nPatients with pathology-confirmed invasive breast cancer treated with adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery in four centers were included. From 2019 to 2020, a total of 230 patients from four nationwide centers in China were screened, of whom 208 were enrolled for DL modeling, and 22 patients from another three centers formed the external testing cohort. The subset of the internal testing cohort (n\u2009=\u200942) formed the internal correlation testing cohort for correlation analysis. The outline of the ipsilateral breast was marked with a lead wire before the scanning. Then, a DL model based on the High-Resolution Net was developed to detect the lead wire marker in each slice of the CT images automatically, and an in-house model was applied to segment the ipsilateral lung region. The mean and standard deviation of the distance error, the average precision, and average recall were used to measure the performance of the lead wire marker detection model. Based on these DL model results, we proposed an organ feature, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the proposed organ feature and ipsilateral lung volume receiving 20 Gray (Gy) or more (V20).\nFor the lead wire marker detection model, the mean and standard deviation of the distance error, AP (5\u00a0mm) and AR (5\u00a0mm) reached 3.415\u2009\u00b1\u20094.529, 0.860, 0.883, and 4.189\u2009\u00b1\u20098.390, 0.848, 0.830 in the internal testing cohort and external testing cohort, respectively. The proposed organ feature calculated from the detected marker correlated with ipsilateral lung V20 (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.542 with p\u2009<\u20090.001 in the internal correlation testing cohort and 0.554 with p\u2009=\u20090.008 in the external testing cohort).\nThe proposed artificial Intelligence-based CT organ feature was correlated with normal lung dose in adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery in patients with invasive breast cancer.\nNCT05609058 (08/11/2022).", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2023-11-10", "authors": ["LiMa", "YongjingYang", "JiabaoMa", "LiMao", "XiuliLi", "LinglingFeng", "MuyashaAbulimiti", "XiaoyongXiang", "FangmengFu", "YutongTan", "WenjueZhang", "Ye-XiongLi", "JingJin", "NingLi"], "doi": "10.1186/s12885-023-11554-2\n10.3322/caac.21708\n10.1080/0284186X.2021.1976828\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.12.016\n10.1186/s13073-021-00968-x\n10.1186/s13014-019-1392-z\n10.1002/mp.14320\n10.1002/rcs.2194\n10.1002/jemt.23688\n10.1002/mp.13271\n10.1016/j.phro.2021.01.006\n10.1109/TPAMI.2020.2983686\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.08.011\n10.7150/jca.21158\n10.1007/s12094-022-03024-1\n10.1186/1748-717X-5-99\n10.3892/ol.2023.13916\n10.1016/j.radonc.2020.05.005\n10.1093/jrr/rrz051\n10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.02.021\n10.1186/s13014-021-01864-9"}
{"title": "Radiotherapy to regional nodes in early breast cancer: an individual patient data meta-analysis of 14\u2009324 women in 16 trials.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy has become much better targeted since the 1980s, improving both safety and efficacy. In breast cancer, radiotherapy to regional lymph nodes aims to reduce risks of recurrence and death. Its effects have been studied in randomised trials, some before the 1980s and some after. We aimed to assess the effects of regional node radiotherapy in these two eras.\nIn this meta-analysis of individual patient data, we sought data from all randomised trials of regional lymph node radiotherapy versus no regional lymph node radiotherapy in women with early breast cancer (including one study that irradiated lymph nodes only if the cancer was right-sided). Trials were identified through the EBCTCG's regular systematic searches of databases including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts. Trials were eligible if they began before Jan 1, 2009. The only systematic difference between treatment groups was in regional node radiotherapy (to the internal mammary chain, supraclavicular fossa, or axilla, or any combinations of these). Primary outcomes were recurrence at any site, breast cancer mortality, non-breast-cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality. Data were supplied by trialists and standardised into a format suitable for analysis. A summary of the formatted data was returned to trialists for verification. Log-rank analyses yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals.\nWe found 17 eligible trials, 16 of which had available data (for 14\u2009324 participants), and one of which (henceforth excluded), had unavailable data (for 165 participants). In the eight newer trials (12\u2009167 patients), which started during 1989-2008, regional node radiotherapy significantly reduced recurrence (rate ratio 0\u00b788, 95% CI 0\u00b781-0\u00b795; p=0\u00b70008). The main effect was on distant recurrence as few regional node recurrences were reported. Radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality (RR 0\u00b787, 95% CI 0\u00b780-0\u00b794; p=0\u00b70010), with no significant effect on non-breast-cancer mortality (0\u00b797, 0\u00b784-1\u00b711; p=0\u00b763), leading to significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0\u00b790, 0\u00b784-0\u00b796; p=0\u00b70022). In an illustrative calculation, estimated absolute reductions in 15-year breast cancer mortality were 1\u00b76% for women with no positive axillary nodes, 2\u00b77% for those with one to three positive axillary nodes, and 4\u00b75% for those with four or more positive axillary nodes. In the eight older trials (2157 patients), which started during 1961-78, regional node radiotherapy had little effect on breast cancer mortality (RR 1\u00b704, 95% CI 0\u00b791-1\u00b720; p=0\u00b755), but significantly increased non-breast-cancer mortality (1\u00b742, 1\u00b718-1\u00b771; p=0\u00b700023), with risk mainly after year 20, and all-cause mortality (1\u00b717, 1\u00b704-1\u00b731; p=0\u00b70067).\nRegional node radiotherapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in trials done after the 1980s, but not in older trials.

{"title": "Artificial Intelligence in Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Personalized Medicine.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is a significant cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Early and precise diagnosis is crucial, and clinical outcomes can be markedly enhanced. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era, notably in image analysis, paving the way for major advancements in breast cancer diagnosis and individualized treatment regimens. In the diagnostic workflow for patients with breast cancer, the role of AI encompasses screening, diagnosis, staging, biomarker evaluation, prognostication, and therapeutic response prediction. Although its potential is immense, its complete integration into clinical practice is challenging. Particularly, these challenges include the imperatives for extensive clinical validation, model generalizability, navigating the \"black-box\" conundrum, and pragmatic considerations of embedding AI into everyday clinical environments. In this review, we comprehensively explored the diverse applications of AI in breast cancer care, underlining its transformative promise and existing impediments. In radiology, we specifically address AI in mammography, tomosynthesis, risk prediction models, and supplementary imaging methods, including magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound. In pathology, our focus is on AI applications for pathologic diagnosis, evaluation of biomarkers, and predictions related to genetic alterations, treatment response, and prognosis in the context of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Our discussion underscores the transformative potential of AI in breast cancer management and emphasizes the importance of focused research to realize the full spectrum of benefits of AI in patient care.", "journal": "Journal of breast cancer", "date": "2023-11-06", "authors": ["Jong SeokAhn", "SangwonShin", "Su-AYang", "Eun KyungPark", "Ki HwanKim", "Soo IckCho", "Chan-YoungOck", "SeokhwiKim"], "doi": "10.4048/jbc.2023.26.e45\n10.1007/978-3-031-43904-9_38"}
{"title": "Machine learning radiomics of magnetic resonance imaging predicts recurrence-free survival after surgery and correlation of LncRNAs in patients with breast cancer: a multicenter cohort study.", "abstract": "Several studies have indicated that magnetic resonance imaging radiomics can predict survival in patients with breast cancer, but the potential biological underpinning remains indistinct. Herein, we aim to develop an interpretable deep-learning-based network for classifying recurrence risk and revealing the potential biological mechanisms.\nIn this multicenter study, 1113 nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer patients were included, and were divided into the training cohort (n\u2009=\u2009698), the validation cohort (n\u2009=\u2009171), and the testing cohort (n\u2009=\u2009244). The Radiomic DeepSurv Net (RDeepNet) model was constructed using the Cox proportional hazards deep neural network DeepSurv for predicting individual recurrence risk. RNA-sequencing was performed to explore the association between radiomics and tumor microenvironment. Correlation and variance analyses were conducted to examine changes of radiomics among patients with different therapeutic responses and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The association and quantitative relation of radiomics and epigenetic molecular characteristics were further analyzed to reveal the mechanisms of radiomics.\nThe RDeepNet model showed a significant association with recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR 0.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.06, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and achieved AUCs of 0.98, 0.94, and 0.92 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year RFS, respectively.\u00a0In the validation and testing cohorts, the RDeepNet model could also clarify patients into high- and low-risk groups, and demonstrated AUCs of 0.91 and 0.94 for 3-year RFS, respectively. Radiomic features displayed differential expression between the two risk groups. Furthermore, the generalizability of RDeepNet model was confirmed across different molecular subtypes and patient populations with different therapy regimens (All P\u2009<\u20090.001). The study also identified variations in radiomic features among patients with diverse therapeutic responses and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Importantly, a significant correlation between radiomics and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was discovered. A key lncRNA was found to be noninvasively quantified by a deep learning-based radiomics prediction model with AUCs of 0.79 in the training cohort and 0.77 in the testing cohort.\nThis study demonstrates that machine learning radiomics of MRI can effectively predict RFS after surgery in patients with breast cancer, and highlights the feasibility of non-invasive quantification of lncRNAs using radiomics, which indicates the potential of radiomics in guiding treatment decisions.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2023-11-02", "authors": ["YunfangYu", "WeiRen", "ZifanHe", "YongjianChen", "YujieTan", "LuhuiMao", "WenhaoOuyang", "NianLu", "JieOuyang", "KaiChen", "ChenchenLi", "RongZhang", "ZhuoWu", "FengxiSu", "ZehuaWang", "QiugenHu", "ChuanmiaoXie", "HeruiYao"], "doi": "10.1186/s13058-023-01688-3\n10.1200/JCO.2015.62.3504\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602253\n10.1056/NEJMoa1510764\n10.6004/jnccn.2020.0016\n10.1093/jnci/djaa149\n10.1038/s41467-021-22188-y\n10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1\n10.1126/sciadv.aba6156\n10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00024-3\n10.1136/bmj.39335.541782.AD\n10.1093/annonc/mdt303\n10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0339\n10.1089/omi.2011.0118\n10.1126/science.1127647\n10.1038/s41576-019-0122-6\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-3779\n10.1080/19490976.2019.1695494\n10.1038/onc.2016.25\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-4067\n10.1002/jmri.26648\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3783\n10.1007/BF02967635\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2019.05.001\n10.1056/NEJMoa041588\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1282\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.2561\n10.1016/j.immuni.2017.10.008\n10.1038/ncomms5006\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103460"}

Mammography is one basic yet efficient test for screening breast cancer. Very few comprehensive surveys have been presented to briefly analyze methods for detecting breast cancer with mammograms. In this article, our objective is to give an overview of recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based breast cancer detection systems.\nWe give a structured framework to categorize mammogram-based breast cancer detection techniques. Several publicly available mammogram databases and different performance measures are also mentioned.\nAfter deliberate investigation, we find most of the works classify breast tumors either as normal-abnormal or malignant-benign rather than classifying them into three classes. Furthermore, DL-based features are more significant than hand-crafted features. However, transfer learning is preferred over others as it yields better performance in small datasets, unlike classical DL techniques.\nIn this article, we have made an attempt to give recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-based breast cancer detection systems.

{"title": "Deep learning to predict breast cancer sentinel lymph node status on INSEMA histological images.", "abstract": "Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is a clinically important prognostic biomarker in breast cancer and is used to guide therapy, especially for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative cases. However, invasive lymph node staging is increasingly omitted before therapy, and studies such as the randomised Intergroup Sentinel Mamma\u00a0(INSEMA) trial address the potential for further de-escalation of axillary surgery. Therefore, it would be helpful to accurately predict the pretherapeutic sentinel status using medical images.\nUsing a ResNet 50 architecture pretrained on ImageNet and a previously successful strategy, we trained deep learning (DL)-based image analysis algorithms to predict sentinel status on hematoxylin/eosin-stained images of predominantly luminal, primary breast tumours from the INSEMA trial and three additional, independent cohorts (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts from the University hospitals of Mannheim and Regensburg), and compared their performance with that of a logistic regression using clinical data only. Performance on an INSEMA hold-out set was investigated in a blinded manner.\nNone of the generated image analysis algorithms yielded significantly better than random areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves on the test sets, including the hold-out test set from INSEMA. In contrast, the logistic regression fitted on the Mannheim cohort\u00a0retained a better than random performance on INSEMA and Regensburg. Including the image analysis model output in the logistic regression did not improve performance further on INSEMA.\nEmploying DL-based image analysis on histological slides, we could not predict SLN status for unseen cases in the INSEMA trial and other predominantly luminal cohorts.", "journal": "European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)", "date": "2023-10-28", "authors": ["FrederikMarm\u00e9", "EvaKrieghoff-Henning", "BerndGerber", "MaxSchmitt", "Dirk-MichaelZahm", "DirkBauerschlag", "HelmutForstbauer", "GuidoHildebrandt", "BeyhanAtaseven", "TobiasBrodkorb", "CarstenDenkert", "AngritStachs", "DavidKrug", "J\u00f6rgHeil", "MichaelGolatta", "ThorstenK\u00fchn", "ValentinaNekljudova", "TimoGaiser", "RebeccaSch\u00f6nmehl", "ChristophBrochhausen", "SibylleLoibl", "ToralfReimer", "Titus JBrinker"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejca.2023.113390"}
{"title": "Extensive clinical testing of Deep Learning Segmentation models for thorax and breast cancer radiotherapy planning.", "abstract": "The performance of deep learning segmentation (DLS) models for automatic organ extraction from CT images in the thorax and breast regions was investigated. Furthermore, the readiness and feasibility of integrating DLS into clinical practice were addressed by measuring the potential time savings and dosimetric impact.\nThirty patients referred to radiotherapy for breast cancer were prospectively included. A total of 23 clinically relevant left- and right-sided organs were contoured manually on CT images according to ESTRO guidelines. Next, auto-segmentation was executed, and the geometric agreement between the auto-segmented and manually contoured organs was qualitatively assessed applying a scale in the range [0-not acceptable, 3-no corrections]. A quantitative validation was carried out by calculating Dice coefficients (DSC) and the 95% percentile of Hausdorff distances (HD95). The dosimetric impact of optimizing the treatment plans on the uncorrected DLS contours, was investigated from a dose coverage analysis using DVH values of the manually delineated contours as references.\nThe qualitative analysis showed that 93% of the DLS generated OAR contours did not need corrections, except for the heart where 67% of the contours needed corrections. The majority of DLS generated CTVs needed corrections, whereas a minority were deemed not acceptable. Still, using the DLS-model for CTV and heart delineation is on average 14 minutes faster. An average DSC=0.91 and H95=9.8 mm were found for the left and right breasts, respectively. Likewise, and average DSC in the range [0.66, 0.76]mm and HD95 in the range [7.04, 12.05]mm were found for the lymph nodes.\nThe validation showed that the DLS generated OAR contours can be used clinically.

{"title": "Predicting diagnosis and survival of bone metastasis in breast cancer using machine learning.", "abstract": "This study aimed at establishing more accurate predictive models based on novel machine learning algorithms, with the overarching goal of providing clinicians with effective decision-making assistance. We retrospectively analyzed the breast cancer patients recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2016. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for bone metastases in breast cancer, whereas Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify prognostic factors for breast cancer with bone metastasis (BCBM). Based on the identified risk and prognostic factors, we developed diagnostic and prognostic models that incorporate six machine learning classifiers. We then used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), learning curve, precision curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis to evaluate performance of the machine learning models. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that bone metastases were significantly associated with age, race, sex, grade, T stage, N stage, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, tumor size, brain metastasis, liver metastasis, lung metastasis, breast subtype, and PR. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that age, race, marital status, grade, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, brain metastasis, liver metastasis, lung metastasis, breast subtype, ER, and PR were closely associated with the prognosis of BCBM. Among the six machine learning models, the XGBoost algorithm predicted the most accurate results (Diagnostic model AUC\u2009=\u20090.98; Prognostic model AUC\u2009=\u20090.88). According to the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), the most critical feature of the diagnostic model was surgery, followed by N stage. Interestingly, surgery was also the most critical feature of prognostic model, followed by liver metastasis.

{"title": "Personalized Breast Cancer Screening.", "abstract": "Abundant literature and clinical trials indicate that routine cancer screenings decrease patient mortality for several common cancers. However, current national cancer screening guidelines heavily rely on patient age as the predominant factor in deciding cancer screening timing, neglecting other important medical characteristics of individual patients. This approach either delays screening or prescribes excessive screenings. Another disadvantage of the current approach is its inability to combine information across hospital systems because of the lack of a coherent records system.\nWe propose to use claims data and medical insurance transactions that use consistent and pre-established sets of codes for diagnosis, procedures, and medications to develop a clinical support tool to supply supplemental insights and precautions for physicians to make more informed decisions. Furthermore, we propose a novel machine learning framework to recommend personalized, data-driven, and dynamic screening decisions.\nWe apply this new method to the study of breast cancer mammograms using claims data from 378,840 female patients to demonstrate that across different risk populations, personalized screening reduces the average delay in a cancer diagnosis by 2-3 months with statistical significance, with even stronger benefits for individual patients up to 10 months.\nIncorporating personal medical characteristics using claims data and novel machine learning methodologies into breast cancer screening improves screening delay by more dynamically considering changing patient risks.

{"title": "Cancer care at the time of the fourth industrial revolution: an insight to healthcare professionals' perspectives on cancer care and artificial intelligence.", "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in cancer care has gained unprecedented global attention over the past few decades. This has impacted the way that cancer care is practiced and delivered across settings. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives and experiences of healthcare professionals (HCPs) on cancer treatment and the need for AI. This study is a part of the INCISIVE European Union H2020 project's development of user requirements, which aims to fully explore the potential of AI-based cancer imaging technologies.\nA mixed-methods research design was employed. HCPs participating in cancer care in the UK, Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, and Serbia were first surveyed anonymously online. Twenty-seven HCPs then participated in semi-structured interviews. Appropriate statistical method was adopted to report the survey results by using SPSS. The interviews were audio recorded, verbatim transcribed, and then thematically analysed supported by NVIVO.\nThe survey drew responses from 95 HCPs. The occurrence of diagnostic delay was reported by 56% (n\u2009=\u200928/50) for breast cancer, 64% (n\u2009=\u200927/42) for lung cancer, 76% (n\u2009=\u200934/45) for colorectal cancer and 42% (n\u2009=\u200916/38) for prostate cancer. A proportion of participants reported the occurrence of false positives in the accuracy of the current imaging techniques used: 64% (n\u2009=\u200932/50) reported this for breast cancer, 60% (n\u2009=\u200925/42) for lung cancer, 51% (n\u2009=\u200923/45) for colorectal cancer and 45% (n\u2009=\u200917/38) for prostate cancer. All participants agreed that the use of technology would enhance the care pathway for cancer patients. Despite the positive perspectives toward AI, certain limitations were also recorded. The majority (73%) of respondents (n\u2009=\u200969/95) reported they had never utilised technology in the care pathway which necessitates the need for education and training in the qualitative finding; compared to 27% (n\u2009=\u200926/95) who had and were still using it. Most, 89% of respondents (n\u2009=\u200985/95) said they would be opened to providing AI-based services in the future to improve medical imaging for cancer care. Interviews with HCPs revealed lack of widespread preparedness for AI in oncology, several barriers to introducing AI, and a need for education and training. Provision of AI training, increasing public awareness of AI, using evidence-based technology, and developing AI based interventions that will not replace HCPs were some of the recommendations.\nHCPs reported favourable opinions of AI-based cancer imaging technologies and noted a number of care pathway concerns where AI can be useful.

This prospective, multistate single-center, cohort study investigated the association of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) status with recurrence in patients with unresectable stage I-III NSCLC who underwent definitive RT.\nA total of 70 serial plasma samples from 17 NSCLC patients were collected before, during, and after treatment. A personalized, tumor-informed ctDNA assay was used to track a set of up to 16 somatic, single nucleotide variants in the associated patient's plasma samples.\nPre-treatment ctDNA detection rate was 82% (14/17) and varied based on histology and stage. ctDNA was detected in 35% (6/17) of patients at the first post-RT timepoint (median of 1.66 months following the completion of RT), all of whom subsequently developed clinical progression. At this first post-RT time point, patients with ctDNA-positivity had significantly worse progression-free survival (PFS) [hazard ratio (HR): 24.2, p=0.004], and ctDNA-positivity was the only significant prognostic factor associated with PFS (HR: 13.4, p=0.02) in a multivariate analysis. All patients who developed clinical recurrence had detectable ctDNA with an average lead time over radiographic progression of 5.4 months, and post-RT ctDNA positivity was significantly associated with poor PFS (p<0.0001).\nPersonalized, longitudinal ctDNA monitoring can detect recurrence early in patients with unresectable NSCLC patients undergoing curative radiation and potentially risk-stratify patients who might benefit most from treatment intensification.", "journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "date": "2023-10-05", "authors": ["Emily SLebow", "NarekShaverdian", "Jordan EEichholz", "Leah BKratochvil", "MeganMcCune", "Yonina RMurciano-Goroff", "JustinJee", "JulianaEng", "Jamie EChaft", "Mark GKris", "EkaterinaKalashnikova", "JordanFeeney", "Carly BessScalise", "SumedhaSudhaman", "Charuta CPalsuledesai", "MeenakshiMalhotra", "MichaelKrainock", "HimanshuSethi", "AlexeyAleshin", "Minetta CLiu", "Annemarie FShepherd", "Abraham JWu", "Charles BSimone", "Daphna YGelblum", "Kaylie AJohnson", "Charles MRudin", "Daniel RGomez", "PedramRazavi", "Jorge SReis-Filho", "James MIsbell", "Bob TLi", "AndreasRimner"], "doi": "10.3389/fonc.2023.1253629\n10.3390/cancers13153759\n10.1016/j.cllc.2015.09.006\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.10.035\n10.1200/PO.21.00181\n10.1038/s43018-019-0011-0\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.0528\n10.1200/JCO.21.01308\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-17-0716\n10.1186/s12943-022-01590-0\n10.1016/j.annonc.2022.02.007\n10.1038/nature22364\n10.1200/JCO.18.02052\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-0`634"}
{"title": "Future of Breast Radiology.", "abstract": "The landscape of breast imaging has transformed significantly since mammography's introduction in the 1960s, accelerated by ultrasound and imageguided biopsies in the 1990s. The emergence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 2000s added a valuable dimension to advanced imaging. Multimodality and multiparametric imaging have firmly established breast radiology's pivotal role in managing breast disorders. A shift from conventional to digital radiology emerged in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, enabling advanced techniques like digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast-enhanced mammography, and artificial intelligence (AI) integration. AI's impending integration into breast radiology may enhance diagnostics and workflows. It involves computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms, workflow support algorithms, and data processing algorithms. CAD systems, developed since the 1980s, optimize cancer detection rates by addressing false positives and negatives. Radiologists' roles will evolve into specialized clinicians collaborating with AI for efficient patient care and utilizing advanced techniques with multiparametric imaging and radiomics. Wearable technologies, non-contrast MRI, and innovative modalities like photoacoustic imaging show potential to enhance diagnostics. Imaging-guided therapy, notably cryotherapy, and theranostics, gains traction. Theranostics, integrating therapy and diagnostics, holds potential for precise treatment.

{"title": "Joint localization and classification of breast masses on ultrasound images using an auxiliary attention-based framework.", "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) methods have been extensively employed for joint localization and classification of breast lesions on ultrasound images to assist in cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment. One typical paradigm in MTL is a shared trunk network architecture. However, such a model design may suffer information-sharing conflicts and only achieve suboptimal performance for individual tasks. Additionally, the model relies on fully-supervised learning methodologies, imposing heavy burdens on data annotation. In this study, we propose a novel joint localization and classification model based on attention mechanisms and a sequential semi-supervised learning strategy to address these challenges. Our proposed framework offers three primary advantages. First, a lesion-aware network with multiple attention modules is designed to improve model performance on lesion localization. An attention-based classifier explicitly establishes correlations between the two tasks, alleviating information-sharing conflicts while leveraging location information to assist in classification. Second, a two-stage sequential semi-supervised learning strategy is designed for model training to achieve optimal performance on both tasks and substantially reduces the need for data annotation. Third, the asymmetric and modular model architecture allows for the flexible interchangeability of individual components, rendering the model adaptable to various applications. Experimental results from two different breast ultrasound image datasets under varied conditions have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive investigations into the impacts of various factors on model performance, gaining in-depth insights into the mechanism of our proposed framework.

The first dataset contained clinical heart delineations from the DBCG RT Nation study (1,561 patients). The second dataset was smaller (114 patients), but with corrected heart delineations. Before training the model on the clinical delineations an outlier-detection was performed, to remove cases with gross deviations from the delineation guideline. No outlier detection was performed for the dataset with corrected heart delineations. Both models were trained with a 3D full resolution nnUNet. The models were evaluated with the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95) and Mean Surface Distance (MSD). The difference between the models were tested with the Mann-Whitney U-test. The balance of dataset quantity versus quality was investigated, by stepwise reducing the cohort size for the model trained on clinical delineations.\nDuring the outlier-detection 137 patients were excluded from the clinical cohort due to non-compliance with delineation guidelines.

Here, we aim to determine whether the administration of low-dose tamoxifen is non-inferior to RT in preventing IBTR in patients with low-risk characteristics of breast DCIS.\nThis is a prospective, international, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial. Patients with low-risk clinicopathologic features (>\u200940\u00a0years old, low risk of breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) 1 and BRCA2 mutations, mammographically detected unicentric and non-mass lesions, low- or intermediate-grade without comedo or necrosis, measuring\u2009<\u20092.5\u00a0cm with margins\u2009\u2265\u20093\u00a0mm, and estrogen receptor-positive status) of DCIS who underwent BCS will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to either receive tamoxifen (5\u00a0mg/day) for 5\u00a0years or undergo RT with conventional fractions (50\u00a0Gy in 25 fractions) or hypofractionations (40.05\u00a0Gy in 15 fractions). Randomization will be stratified by the Taiwan Breast Cancer Consortium. As approximately 5% of patients cannot tolerate the side effects of low-dose tamoxifen and will receive RT, we estimate that 405 patients will be randomized to a low-dose tamoxifen arm and 405 patients to the RT arm, according to a non-inferiority margin within 5% of IBTR difference and 90% \u03b2-power noticing non-inferiority. The primary endpoints are breast tumor recurrence, including ipsilateral, regional, contralateral, and distant recurrence of breast DCIS or invasive cancer. The secondary endpoints are overall survival and adverse effects of RT and tamoxifen.

The study results show that our proposed deep convolutional neural networks model achieved a remarkable success with an accuracy of 84.79% to predict pathological complete response.\nIt was concluded that deep learning methods can predict breast cancer treatment.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2023-09-14", "authors": ["G\u00fclcanBulut", "Hasan IkbalAtilgan", "G\u00f6kalp\u00c7\u0131narer", "Kaz\u0131mK\u0131l\u0131\u00e7", "DenizY\u0131kar", "TubaParlar"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0290543\n10.1093/jnci/dji021\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62422-8\n10.1200/JCO.2007.14.4147\n10.1200/JCO.2011.38.8595\n10.1245/s10434-019-07655-7\n10.1245/s10434-014-4021-y\n10.3348/kjr.2012.13.4.371\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2626\n10.1007/s00259-019-04313-8\n10.1097/MNM.0000000000001332\n10.1007/s10278-020-00357-7\n10.1200/CCI.19.00126\n10.1007/s13244-018-0639-9\n10.1016/j.clbc.2019.11.009\n10.4048/jbc.2020.23.e9\n10.18632/oncotarget.27979\n10.1007/s00259-020-04684-3\n10.4048/jbc.2013.16.3.315"}
{"title": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence for breast cancer: Image augmentation, segmentation, diagnosis, and prognosis approaches.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is a significant global health burden, with increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early screening and accurate diagnosis are crucial for improving prognosis. Radiographic imaging modalities such as digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and nuclear medicine techniques, are commonly used for breast cancer assessment. And histopathology (HP) serves as the gold standard for confirming malignancy. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies show great potential for quantitative representation of medical images to effectively assist in segmentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of breast cancer. In this review, we overview the recent advancements of AI technologies for breast cancer, including 1) improving image quality by data augmentation, 2) fast detection and segmentation of breast lesions and diagnosis of malignancy, 3) biological characterization of the cancer such as staging and subtyping by AI-based classification technologies, 4) prediction of clinical outcomes such as metastasis, treatment response, and survival by integrating multi-omics data. Then, we then summarize large-scale databases available to help train robust, generalizable, and reproducible deep learning models. Furthermore, we conclude the challenges faced by AI in real-world applications, including data curating, model interpretability, and practice regulations. Besides, we expect that clinical implementation of AI will provide important guidance for the patient-tailored management.", "journal": "Seminars in cancer biology", "date": "2023-09-14", "authors": ["JiadongZhang", "JiaojiaoWu", "Xiang SeanZhou", "FengShi", "DinggangShen"], "doi": "10.1016/j.semcancer.2023.09.001"}

We aim to develop a fully automatic system to detect and classify breast lesions using multiple contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) images.\nIn this study, a total of 1,903 females who underwent CEM examination from three hospitals were enrolled as the training set, internal testing set, pooled external testing set and prospective testing set. Here we developed a CEM-based multiprocess detection and classification system (MDCS) to perform the task of detection and classification of breast lesions. In this system, we introduced an innovative auxiliary feature fusion (AFF) algorithm that could intelligently incorporates multiple types of information from CEM images. The average free-response receiver operating characteristic score (AFROC-Score) was presented to validate system's detection performance, and the performance of classification was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Furthermore, we assessed the diagnostic value of MDCS through visual analysis of disputed cases, comparing its performance and efficiency with that of radiologists and exploring whether it could augment radiologists' performance.\nOn the pooled external and prospective testing sets, MDCS always maintained a high standalone performance, with AFROC-Scores of 0.953 and 0.963 for detection task, and AUCs for classification were 0.909 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.822-0.996] and 0.912 (95% CI: 0.840-0.985), respectively. It also achieved higher sensitivity than all senior radiologists and higher specificity than all junior radiologists on pooled external and prospective testing sets. Moreover, MDCS performed superior diagnostic efficiency with an average reading time of 5 seconds, compared to the radiologists' average reading time of 3.2 min. The average performance of all radiologists was also improved to varying degrees with MDCS assistance.\nMDCS demonstrated excellent performance in the detection and classification of breast lesions, and greatly enhanced the overall performance of radiologists.", "journal": "Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu", "date": "2023-09-11", "authors": ["YuqianChen", "ZhenHua", "FanLin", "TiantianZheng", "HengZhou", "ShijieZhang", "JingGao", "ZhongyiWang", "HuafeiShao", "WenjuanLi", "FengjieLiu", "SiminWang", "YanZhang", "FengZhao", "HaoLiu", "HaizhuXie", "HengMa", "HaichengZhang", "NingMao"], "doi": "10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2023.04.07\n10.1038/s41568-020-0266-x\n10.1002/cac2.12207>PMID:34399040>\n10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19980601)82:11<2235::aid-cncr19>3.0.co;2-v\n10.1590/1413-81232015204.17772014\n10.1097/MD.0000000000026531\n10.1186/s13058-015-0525-z\n10.1148/rg.234025083\n10.1007/s00330-019-06232-6\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.11.024>PMID:29279165>\n10.2214/AJR.17.19265\n10.1007/s00330-014-3271-1\n10.1148/radiol.12121084\n10.1186/s12916-022-02258-8\n10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2022.05.10\n10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2022.01.04\n10.1038/s41467-021-26023-2\n10.1109/TMI.2021.3102622\n10.1126/scitranslmed.abo4802\n10.1148/radiol.2020200292\n10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00070-X\n10.1038/s41416-022-02092-y\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.42343\n10.1007/s00330-022-08538-4\n10.1016/j.compmedimag.2018.09.004\n10.1002/mp.15390\n10.1007/s11548-021-02391-4\n10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076\n10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2858826\n10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2577031\n10.1016/j.media.2022.102395\n10.1007/s00330-021-08306-w\n10.1007/s11548-018-1876-6\n10.1016/j.media.2021.102083"}
{"title": "Adapting the pre-trained convolutional neural networks to improve the anomaly detection and classification in mammographic images.", "abstract": "Mortality from breast cancer (BC) is among the top causes of cancer death in women. BC can be effectively treated when diagnosed early, improving the likelihood that a patient will survive. BC masses and calcification clusters must be identified by mammography in order to prevent disease effects and commence therapy at an early stage. A mammography misinterpretation may result in an unnecessary biopsy of the false-positive results, lowering the patient's odds of survival. This study intends to improve breast mass detection and identification in order to provide better therapy and reduce mortality risk. A new deep-learning (DL) model based on a combination of transfer-learning (TL) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed in this study to adequately facilitate the automatic detection and diagnosis of the BC suspicious region using the 80-20 method. Since DL designs are modelled to be problem-specific, TL applies the knowledge gained during the solution of one problem to another relevant problem. In the presented model, the learning features from the pre-trained networks such as the squeezeNet and DenseNet are extracted and transferred with the features that have been extracted from the INbreast dataset. To measure the proposed model performance, we selected accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as our metrics of choice. The classification of mammographic data using the suggested model yielded overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and AUC values of 99.236%, 98.8%, 99.1%, 96%, and 0.998, respectively, demonstrating the model's efficacy in detecting breast tumors.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2023-09-10", "authors": ["AbeerSaber", "Abdelazim GHussien", "Wael AAwad", "AmenaMahmoud", "AlaaAllakany"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-41633-0"}

In order to initiate the treatment, an extensive diagnostic workup is usually required. Radiomics is a discipline aimed at transforming visual data in radiological images into reliable diagnostic information. We aimed to examine the capability of deep learning methods to classify the origin of metastatic lesions in brain MRIs and compare the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods with image texture based features.\nOne hundred forty three patients with 157 metastatic brain tumors were included in the study. The statistical and texture based image features were extracted from metastatic tumors after manual segmentation process. Three powerful pre-trained CNN architectures and the texture-based features on both 2D and 3D tumor images were used to differentiate lung and breast metastases. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for evaluation. Accuracy, precision, recall, and area under curve (AUC) metrics were calculated to analyze the diagnostic performance.\nThe texture-based image features on 3D volumes achieved better discrimination results than 2D image features. The overall performance of CNN architectures with 3D inputs was higher than the texture-based features. Xception architecture, with 3D volumes as input, yielded the highest accuracy (0.85) while the AUC value was 0.84.

Our study aims to develop 2 multimodal ultrasound deep learning (DL) models to noninvasively predict resistance and PCR to NAC before treatment.\nFrom January 2017 to July 2022, a total of 170 patients with breast cancer were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent multimodal ultrasound examination (grayscale 2D ultrasound and ultrasound elastography) before NAC.

In this multicenter validation study, we developed an MRI-based radiomic model to predict the surgical margin status.\nWe retrospectively collected preoperative breast MRI of patients undergoing BCS from three hospitals (SYMH, n = 296; SYSUCC, n = 131; TSPH, n\u00a0= 143). Radiomic-based model for risk prediction of the margin positivity was trained on the SYMH patients (7:3 ratio split for the training and testing cohorts), and externally validated in the SYSUCC and TSPH cohorts. The model was able to stratify patients into different subgroups with varied risk of margin positivity. Moreover, we used the immune-radiomic models and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature to infer the distribution patterns of immune cells and tumor cell EMT status under different marginal status.\nThe AUCs of the radiomic-based model were 0.78 (0.66-0.90), 0.88 (0.79-0.96), and 0.76 (0.68-0.84) in the testing cohort and two external validation cohorts, respectively. The actual margin positivity rates ranged between 0-10% and 27.3-87.2% in low-risk and high-risk subgroups, respectively. Positive surgical margin was associated with higher levels of EMT and B cell infiltration in the tumor area, as well as the enrichment of B cells, immature dendritic cells, and neutrophil infiltration in the peritumoral area.\nThis MRI-based predictive model can be used as a reliable tool to predict the risk of margin positivity of BCS.

{"title": "A narrative review for radiation oncologists to implement preoperative partial breast irradiation.", "abstract": "The strategy to anticipate radiotherapy (RT) before surgery, for breast cancer (BC) treatment, has recently generated a renewed interest. Historically, preoperative RT has remained confined either to highly selected patients, in the context of personalized therapy, or to clinical research protocols. Nevertheless, in the recent years, thanks to technological advances and increased tumor biology understanding, RT has undergone great changes that have also impacted the preoperative settings, embracing the modern approach to breast cancer. In particular, the reappraisal of preoperative RT can be viewed within the broader view of personalized and tailored medicine. In fact, preoperative accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) allows a more precise target delineation, with less variability in contouring among radiation oncologists, and a smaller treatment volume, possibly leading to lower toxicity and to dose escalation programs. The aim of the present review, which represents a benchmark study for the AIRC IG-23118, is to report available data on different technical aspects of preoperative RT including dosimetric studies, patient's selection and set-up, constraints, target delineation and clinical results. These data, along with the ones that will become available from ongoing studies, may inform the design of the future trials and representing a step toward a tailored APBI approach with the potential to challenge the current treatment paradigm in early-stage BC.Trial registration: The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04679454).", "journal": "La Radiologia medica", "date": "2023-08-31", "authors": ["Maria AlessiaZerella", "MattiaZaffaroni", "GiuseppeRonci", "SamanthaDicuonzo", "Damaris PatriciaRojas", "AnnaMorra", "Marianna AlessandraGerardi", "CristianaFodor", "ElenaRondi", "SabrinaVigorito", "SilviaPenco", "ManuelaSargenti", "PaolaBaratella", "ElisaVicini", "ConsueloMorigi", "SabrinaKahler-Ribeiro-Fontana", "Viviana EnricaGalimberti", "SaraGandini", "ElisaDe Camilli", "GiuseppeRenne", "FedericaCattani", "PaoloVeronesi", "RobertoOrecchia", "Barbara AlicjaJereczek-Fossa", "Maria CristinaLeonardi"], "doi": "10.1007/s11547-023-01706-6\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2019.06.003\n10.3389/fonc.2021.779185\n10.1038/s41598-022-18251-3\n10.1186/s13058-017-0870-1\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.01.022\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.03.027\n10.3390/curroncol29120768\n10.1016/j.radonc.2011.08.017\n10.1159/000507041\n10.3390/cancers14184531\n10.1016/j.radonc.2022.02.033\n10.1120/jacmp.v16i1.5126\n10.1016/j.radonc.2013.10.033\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.01.041\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.04.063\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.09.041\n10.1097/COC.0b013e3182467ffd\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0822\n10.1016/j.adro.2018.05.002\n10.1016/j.radonc.2015.09.023\n10.1259/bjr.20170565\n10.1016/j.brachy.2020.10.005\n10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00539-8\n10.1016/j.prro.2015.02.002\n10.1016/0167-8140(89)90037-6\n10.1016/0167-8140(88)90222-8\n10.3747/co.27.6059\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.11.030\n10.1159/000516114\n10.3747/co.26.4479\n10.1016/j.ejca.2010.02.015\n10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8080\n10.1186/1748-717X-9-63\n10.1186/s12885-017-3144-5\n10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2020.151601\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.10.034\n10.1159/000449388\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.12.037\n10.1016/S0360-3016(98)00507-0\n10.1016/0360-3016(85)90027-6\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.03.007\n10.1177/1533034615593191\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2008.04.004\n10.1118/1.3438081\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.07.1754\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.01.020\n10.1200/JCO.2013.50.5511\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.01.009\n10.1186/1748-717X-6-155\n10.1007/s10549-013-2623-x\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.05.025\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.05.059\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2008.04.001\n10.1016/j.addr.2016.11.005\n10.1016/S0360-3016(02)02785-2\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2018.05.031\n10.1158/1538-7445.SABCS19-P4-12-07\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.11.406\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.12.037\n10.1007/s12032-011-9842-y\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2010.10.004\n10.1097/RCT.0000000000001001\n10.1016/j.clbc.2021.06.016\n10.1002/cncr.32599\n10.1016/j.clbc.2020.01.012\n10.1016/j.breast.2017.01.013\n10.1007/s11912-017-0627-0\n10.1016/j.breast.2017.05.013\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.05.011\n10.1159/000355196\n10.1016/S1470-2045(22)00613-1\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.09.002\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.06.014"}

We proposed a fusion model that combined deep learning features extracted from ResNet18-based multi-input residual convolution network with traditional radiomics features. Specifically, the fusion model adopted a multi-region strategy, incorporating the aforementioned features from both the ITR and PTR. Then, we randomly divided the dataset into training and validation sets using fivefold cross-validation approach. Comprehensive comparative experiments were performed between the proposed fusion model and other eight models, including the intra-tumoral deep learning model, the intra-tumoral radiomics model, the intra-tumoral deep-learning radiomics model, the peri-tumoral deep learning model, the peri-tumoral radiomics model, the peri-tumoral deep-learning radiomics model, the multi-region radiomics model, and the multi-region deep-learning model.\nThe fusion model developed using deep-learning radiomics feature sets extracted from the ITR and PTR had the best classification performance, with the area under the curve of 0.913 (95% CI 0.840-0.960).

{"title": "AI-Based Cancer Detection Model for Contrast-Enhanced Mammography.", "abstract": "The recent development of deep neural network models for the analysis of breast images has been a breakthrough in computer-aided diagnostics (CAD). Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a recent mammography modality providing anatomical and functional imaging of the breast. Despite the clinical benefits it could bring, only a few research studies have been conducted around deep-learning (DL) based CAD for CEM, especially because the access to large databases is still limited. This study presents the development and evaluation of a CEM-CAD for enhancing lesion detection and breast classification.\nA deep learning enhanced cancer detection model based on a YOLO architecture has been optimized and trained on a large CEM dataset of 1673 patients (7443 images) with biopsy-proven lesions from various hospitals and acquisition systems. The evaluation was conducted using metrics derived from the free receiver operating characteristic (FROC) for the lesion detection and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to evaluate the overall breast classification performance. The performances were evaluated for different types of image input and for each patient background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) level.\nThe optimized model achieved an area under the curve (AUROC) of 0.964 for breast classification. Using both low-energy and recombined image as inputs for the DL model shows greater performance than using only the recombined image. For the lesion detection, the model was able to detect 90% of all cancers with a false positive (non-cancer) rate of 0.128 per image. This study demonstrates a high impact of BPE on classification and detection performance.\nThe developed CEM CAD outperforms previously published papers and its performance is comparable to radiologist-reported classification and detection capability.", "journal": "Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2023-08-26", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mentJailin", "SaraMohamed", "RazvanIordache", "PabloMilioni De Carvalho", "Salwa YehiaAhmed", "Engy AbdullahAbdel Sattar", "Amr Farouk IbrahimMoustafa", "Mohammed MohammedGomaa", "Rashaa MohammedKamal", "LaurenceVancamberg"], "doi": "10.3390/bioengineering10080974\n10.3322/caac.21262\n10.5306/wjco.v2.i4.171\n10.1002/mp.13264\n10.1007/s12194-019-00552-4\n10.1038/s41598-019-48995-4\n10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30003-0\n10.1007/s00330-010-1944-y\n10.3348/kjr.2014.15.6.689\n10.1097/01.rli.0000167421.83203.4e\n10.1093/jbi/wbz074\n10.1148/radiol.2021201948\n10.1007/s00330-016-4650-6\n10.3390/e21111110\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.11.024\n10.3389/fonc.2020.573630\n10.3390/diagnostics11040684\n10.1007/s11548-018-1876-6\n10.1007/s00330-022-08538-4\n10.1002/mp.14610\n10.3390/diagnostics12123133\n10.1186/s40644-015-0036-2\n10.3389/fonc.2022.943415\n10.1038/s41597-022-01238-0\n10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.101913\n10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2577031\n10.1186/s12938-023-01115-w\n10.1186/s13244-022-01211-w\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103774\n10.1016/j.clbc.2018.06.003\n10.7150/jca.79747\n10.1007/s10439-018-2044-4\n10.2214/ajr.175.3.1750603\n10.1016/j.crad.2017.10.017\n10.1007/s11042-022-12332-1\n10.1016/j.media.2021.102204"}
{"title": "Exploring the Use of a Digital Platform for Cancer Patients to Report Their Demographics, Disease and Therapy Characteristics, Age, and Educational Disparities: An Early-Stage Feasibility Study.", "abstract": "The increasing burden of cancer, the development of novel therapies, and the COVID-19 pandemic have made cancer care more complex. Digital innovation was then pushed toward developing platforms to facilitate access to cancer care. Age, education, and other disparities were, however, shown to limit the use of the digital health innovation. The aim of this early-stage feasibility study was to assess whether Greek cancer patients would register at CureCancer and self-report their demographics, disease and therapy characteristics, and socioeconomic issues. The study was organized by the Hellenic Society of Medical Oncology.\nPatients from nine cancer centers were invited to register on the CureCancer platform and complete an anonymous questionnaire on demographics, disease and therapy characteristics, and socioeconomic issues. Patients were also encouraged to upload, in a secure area for them, their medical files and share them with their physicians. They were then asked to comment on their experience of registration and how easy it was to upload their medical files.\nOf the 159 patients enrolled, 144 (90.56%) registered, and 114 of those (79.16%) completed the questionnaire, suggesting that the study is feasible. Users' median age was 54.5 years, and 86.8% of them were university and high school graduates. Most patients (79.8%) reported their specific type of cancer diagnosis, and all reported their therapy characteristics. Breast and lung cancers were the most common. A total of 87 patients (76.3%) reported being on active cancer therapy, 46 (40.4%) had metastatic disease, and 51 (44.7%) received supportive care medications. Eighty-one (71.05%) patients received prior cancer therapies, and twenty-seven recalled prior supportive care medications. All patients reported visiting non-oncology Health Care Professionals during the study. Nineteen of 72 (26.39%) patients who worked prior to cancer diagnosis changed work status; 49 (42.98) patients had children under 24 years; and 16 (14%) patients lived alone. Nine (7.9%) patients were members of patient associations. Registration was \"much/very much\" easy for 98 (86.0%) patients, while 67 (58.8%) had difficulties uploading their files. Patients commented on the well-organized data access, improved communication, feeling safe, medication adherence, interventions from a distance, and saving time and money. Over 80% of patients \"preferred the digital way\".\nA total of 114 patients succeeded in registering on the digital platform and reporting their demographics, disease and therapy characteristics, and socioeconomic issues. Age and educational disparities were disclosed and highlighted the need for educational programs to help older people and people of lower education use digital innovation. Health care policy measures would support patients' financial burden associated with work changes, living alone, and children under 24 years old at school or college.

{"title": "Mean Heart Dose Prediction Using Parameters of Single-Slice Computed Tomography and Body Mass Index: Machine Learning Approach for Radiotherapy of Left-Sided Breast Cancer of Asian Patients.", "abstract": "Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) is an excellent technique to reduce the incidental radiation received by the heart during radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer. However, DIBH is costly and time-consuming for patients and radiotherapy staff. In Asian countries, the use of DIBH is restricted due to the limited number of patients with a high mean heart dose (MHD) and the shortage of radiotherapy personnel and equipment compared to that in the USA. This study aimed to develop, evaluate, and compare the performance of ten machine learning algorithms for predicting MHD using a patient's body mass index and single-slice CT parameters to identify patients who may not require DIBH. Machine learning models were built and tested using a dataset containing 207 patients with left-sided breast cancer who were treated with field-in-field radiotherapy with free breathing. The average MHD was 251 cGy. Stratified repeated four-fold cross-validation was used to build models using 165 training data. The models were compared internally using their average performance metrics: F2 score, AUC, recall, accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient. The final performance evaluation for each model was further externally analyzed using 42 unseen test data.

Whereas deep learning techniques have allowed oncologists to automate the CTV delineation, multi-site tumor analysis is often lacking in the literature. This study aimed to evaluate the deep learning models that automatically contour CTVs of tumors at various sites on computed tomography (CT) images from objective and subjective perspectives.\n577 patients were selected for the present study, including nasopharyngeal (n\u2009=\u200934), esophageal (n\u2009=\u200940), breast-conserving surgery (BCS) (left-sided, n\u2009=\u200971; right-sided, n\u2009=\u200971), breast-radical mastectomy (BRM) (left-sided, n\u2009=\u200943; right-sided, n\u2009=\u200937), cervical (radical radiotherapy, n\u2009=\u200945; postoperative, n\u2009=\u200985), prostate (n\u2009=\u200942), and rectal (n\u2009=\u2009109) carcinomas. Manually delineated CTV contours by radiation oncologists are served as ground truth. Four models were evaluated: Flexnet, Unet, Vnet, and Segresnet, which are commercially available in the medical product \"AccuLearning AI model training platform\". The data were divided into the training, validation, and testing set at a ratio of 5:1:4. The geometric metrics, including Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), were calculated for objective evaluation. For subjective assessment, oncologists rated the segmentation contours of the testing set visually.\nHigh correlations were observed between automatic and manual contours. Based on the results of the independent test group, most of the patients achieved satisfactory quantitative results (DSC\u2009>\u20090.8), except for patients with esophageal carcinoma (DSC: 0.62-0.64). The subjective review indicated that 82.65% of predicted CTVs scored either as clinically accepting (8.68%) or requiring minor revision (73.97%), and no patients were scored as rejected.\nThis experimental work demonstrated that auto-generated contours could serve as an initial template to help oncologists save time in CTV delineation.

{"title": "Association of radiation dose to cardiac substructures with major ischaemic events following breast cancer radiotherapy.", "abstract": "Patients with left-sided breast cancer receive a higher mean heart dose (MHD) after radiotherapy, with subsequent risk of ischaemic heart disease. However, the optimum dosimetric predictor among cardiac substructures has not yet been determined.\nThis study retrospectively reviewed 2158 women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was a major ischaemic event. The dose-volume parameters of each delineated cardiac substructure were calculated. The risk factors for major ischaemic events and the association between MHD and major ischaemic events were analysed by Cox regression. The optimum dose-volume predictors among cardiac substructures were explored in multivariable models by comparing performance metrics of each model. At a median follow-up of 7.9 years (interquartile range 5.6-10.8 years), 89 patients developed major ischaemic events. The cumulative incidence rate of major ischaemic events was significantly higher in left-sided disease (P = 0.044). Overall, MHD increased the risk of major ischaemic events by 6.2% per Gy (hazard ratio 1.062, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.12; P = 0.012). The model containing the volume of the left ventricle receiving 25 Gy (LV V25) with the cut-point of 4% presented with the best goodness of fit and discrimination performance in left-sided breast cancer.

{"title": "Evolution of Breast Cancer Recurrence Risk Prediction: A Systematic Review of Statistical and Machine Learning-Based Models.", "abstract": "Selection of appropriate adjuvant therapy to ultimately reduce the risk of breast cancer (BC) recurrence is a challenge for medical oncologists. Several automated risk prediction models have been developed using retrospective clinical data and have evolved significantly over the years in terms of predictors of recurrence, data usage, and predictive techniques (statistical/machine learning [ML]).\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature review of the aforementioned statistical and ML models published between January 2008 and December 2022 through searching five digital databases-PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. The comprehensive search yielded a total of 163 papers and after a screening process focusing on papers that dealt exclusively with statistical/ML methods, only 23 papers were deemed appropriate for further analysis. We benchmarked the studies on the basis of development, evaluation metrics, and validation strategy with an added emphasis on racial diversity of patients included in the studies.\nIn total, 30.4% of the included studies use statistical techniques, while 69.6% are ML-based. Among these, traditional ML models (support vector machines, decision tree, logistic regression, and na\u00efve Bayes) are the most frequently used (26.1%) along with deep learning (26.1%). Deep learning and ensemble learning provide the most accurate predictions (AUC = 0.94 each).\nML-based prediction models exhibit outstanding performance, yet their practical applicability might be hindered by limited interpretability and reduced generalization. Moreover, predictive models for BC recurrence often focus on limited variables related to tumor, treatment, molecular, and clinical features.

{"title": "Bibliometric analysis of the global scientific production on machine learning applied to different cancer types.", "abstract": "Cancer disease is one of the main causes of death in the world, with million annual cases in the last decades. The need to find a cure has stimulated the search for efficient treatments and diagnostic procedures. One of the most promising tools that has emerged against cancer in recent years is machine learning (ML), which has raised a huge number of scientific papers published in a relatively short period of time. The present study analyzes global scientific production on ML applied to the most relevant cancer types through various bibliometric indicators. We find that over 30,000 studies have been published so far and observe that cancers with the highest number of published studies using ML (breast, lung, and colon cancer) are those with the highest incidence, being the USA and China the main scientific producers on the subject. Interestingly, the role of China and Japan in stomach cancer is correlated with the number of cases of this cancer type in Asia (78% of the worldwide cases). Knowing the countries and institutions that most study each area can be of great help for improving international collaborations between research groups and countries. Our analysis shows that medical and computer science journals lead the number of publications on the subject and could be useful for researchers in the field.

The control group will have access to the standard approach. The primary objectives of the trial will be i) to examine the differences between the treatment arms with regards to patients' pre-treatment expectations and the final aesthetic outcomes and ii) in the experimental arm only, the agreement of the pre-treatment AI-evaluation (output) and patient's post-therapy self-evaluation.\nThe project aims to develop an easy-to-use cost-effective AI-powered tool that improves shared decision-making processes.

We aimed to identify the degree of agreement between the AI-CDSS, Watson for Oncology (WFO), and the clinician in treatment recommendations for Korean breast cancer patients and to provide guidelines for future improvement.\nOne hundred and eighty-three breast cancer patients who underwent treatment at the Pusan National University Hospital between January 1, 2016 and May 31, 2017 were enrolled in this study. The concordance between WFO's and clinicians' treatment recommendations were examined according to various factors.\nWFO gave the same treatment option recommendations as clinicians in 74 (40.4%) of the cases. According to the logistic regression, the difference in recommendation concordance between stage I and stage III was statistically significant (P = 0.004), and there was no difference among other factors.\nThe concordance of treatment recommendations was low overall.

Here we report on the pre-planned extension of the study. The pre-specified primary hypothesis was that AI therapy for 24 months would lead to increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area when compared to controls.\nWe completed a 12-month extension to our prospective 12-month cohort study of 52 women commencing AI treatment (median age 64.5 years) and 52 women with breast pathology not requiring endocrine therapy (63.5 years). Our primary outcome of interest was VAT area. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included other measures of body composition, hepatic steatosis, measures of atherosclerosis and vascular reactivity. Using mixed models and the addition of a fourth time point, we increased the number of study observations by 79 and were able to rigorously determine the treatment effect.\nAmong study completers (AI = 39, controls = 40), VAT area was comparable between groups over 24 months, the mean-adjusted difference was -1.54 cm2 (95% CI: -14.9; 11.9, P = 0.79). Both groups demonstrated parallel and continuous increases in VAT area over the observation period that did not diverge or change between groups. No statistically significant difference in our secondary and exploratory outcomes was observed between groups.\nWhile these findings provide reassurance that short-to-medium-term exposure to AI therapy is not associated with metabolically adverse changes when compared to controls, risk evolution should be less focussed on the AI-associated effect and more on the general development of cardiovascular risk over time.", "journal": "Endocrine connections", "date": "2023-07-31", "authors": ["Yee-Ming MCheung", "RudolfHoermann", "KarenVan", "DamianWu", "JennyHealy", "BellaHalim", "ManjriRaval", "MariaMcGill", "AliAl-Fiadh", "MichaelChao", "ShaneWhite", "BelindaYeo", "Jeffrey DZajac", "MathisGrossmann"], "doi": "10.1530/EC-23-0076\n10.1309/4wv79n2ghj3x1841\n10.1054/bjoc.2001.1925\n10.1016/s0140-6736(1561074-1\n10.1056/NEJMoa2104162\n10.1371/journal.pone.0184174\n10.1097/EDE.0000000000000394\n10.1007/s10549-011-1754-1\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.0429\n10.1002/clc.23114\n10.1016/j.ejca.2016.08.022\n10.1016/j.breast.2021.07.004\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044750\n10.1111/jcpt.13598\n10.1177/10732748221132512\n10.1093/aje/kwi324\n10.1210/jc.2004-0015\n10.1210/js.2019-00096\n10.1210/jc.2017-02449\n10.1097/GME.0000000000000430\n10.1161/circulationaha.106.675355\n10.1016/j.ejim.2013.07.001\n10.1111/cen.14839\n10.1038/oby.2011.367\n10.1155/2019/2193723\n10.1016/j.orcp.2020.10.005\n10.1016/j.jacc.2004.08.062\n10.1016/j.clinre.2011.08.001\n10.1016/j.jhep.2013.12.018\n10.1371/journal.pone.0182784\n10.1148/radiol.2017162931\n10.1016/j.jocd.2006.05.007\n10.1016/s0021-9150(9700106-8\n10.1016/j.clbc.2014.02.003\n10.18637/jss.v067.i01\n10.18637/jss.v087.i09\n10.2307/271083\n10.1210/jc.2018-02339\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6603258\n10.1007/s10549-010-1223-2\n10.1007/s10549-017-4447-6\n10.1097/MCA.0000000000000666\n10.1007/s10549-016-3985-7\n10.1161/01.cir.103.11.1529\n10.1359/jbmr.071024\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2008.10.013\n10.1200/JCO.2017.76.3524"}

Although imaging remains pivotal to assess response to PST accurately, the use of imaging to predict response to PST has the potential to not only better prognostication but also allow the de-escalation or omission of potentially toxic treatment with undesirable adverse effects, the accelerated implementation of new targeted therapies, and the mitigation of surgical delays in selected patients. In response to the limited ability of radiologists to predict response to PST via qualitative, subjective assessments of tumors on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), artificial intelligence-enhanced MRI with classical machine learning, and in more recent times, deep learning, have been used with promising results to predict response, both before the start of PST and in the early stages of treatment.

A noninvasive quantitative measure of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) may be valuable for predicting treatment response. Purpose To develop a quantitative measure of ITH on pretreatment MRI scans and test its performance for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods Pretreatment MRI scans were retrospectively acquired in patients with breast cancer who received NAC followed by surgery at multiple centers from January 2000 to September 2020. Conventional radiomics (hereafter, C-radiomics) and intratumoral ecological diversity features were extracted from the MRI scans, and output probabilities of imaging-based decision tree models were used to generate a C-radiomics score and ITH index. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with pCR, and significant variables, including clinicopathologic variables, C-radiomics score, and ITH index, were combined into a predictive model for which performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

{"title": "Ribosome biosynthesis and Hedgehog activity are cooperative actionable signaling mechanisms in breast cancer following radiotherapy.", "abstract": "Hyperactivated ribosome biosynthesis is attributed to a need for elevated protein synthesis that accommodates cell growth and division, and is characterized by nucleomorphometric alterations and increased nucleolar counts. Ribosome biogenesis is challenged when DNA-damaging treatments such as radiotherapy are utilized. Tumor cells that survive radiotherapy form the basis of recurrence, tumor progression, and metastasis. In order to survive and become metabolically revitalized, tumor cells need to reactivate RNA Polymerase I (RNA Pol I) to synthesize ribosomal RNA, an integral component of ribosomes. In this study, we showed that following radiation therapy, tumor cells from breast cancer patients demonstrate activation of a ribosome biosynthesis signature concurrent with enrichment of a signature of Hedgehog (Hh) activity. We hypothesized that GLI1 activates RNA Pol I in response to irradiation and licenses the emergence of a radioresistant tumor population. Our work establishes a novel role for GLI1 in orchestrating RNA Pol I activity in irradiated breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that in these irradiated tumor cells, Treacle ribosome biogenesis factor 1 (TCOF1), a nucleolar protein that is important in ribosome biogenesis, facilitates nucleolar translocation of GLI1. Inhibiting Hh activity and RNA Pol I activity disabled the outgrowth of breast cancer cells in the lungs. As such, ribosome biosynthesis and Hh activity present as actionable signaling mechanisms to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy.", "journal": "NPJ precision oncology", "date": "2023-06-29", "authors": ["Brandon JMetge", "Heba AAlsheikh", "DongquanChen", "Amr RElhamamsy", "Dominique CHinshaw", "Bo-RueiChen", "Barry PSleckman", "Rajeev SSamant", "Lalita AShevde"], "doi": "10.1038/s41698-023-00410-y\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-4087\n10.1007/s00018-019-03231-0\n10.1038/nrc.2017.104\n10.1111/his.14036\n10.1259/bjr.20120601\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.08.085\n10.1101/gad.260703.115\n10.1093/nar/gkaa733\n10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60488-8\n10.1093/nar/gkz518\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.01.003\n10.1042/bss0730203\n10.1038/s41580-020-0237-9\n10.1038/ncb3007\n10.1093/nar/gkz518\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0134\n10.3390/cells8050394\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0734\n10.1038/s41416-020-01151-6\n10.1016/j.isci.2020.102010\n10.1038/srep18100\n10.1093/jmcb/mju038\n10.1139/O07-069\n10.1074/jbc.M114.606483\n10.1083/jcb.200804042\n10.1182/blood.V92.6.2118\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1459\n10.1074/jbc.M110.173393\n10.1016/j.molcel.2007.09.023\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.102961\n10.1038/s41467-019-10100-8\n10.1080/15384047.2018.1456599\n10.1002/onco.13959\n10.1172/JCI40252\n10.1038/s41389-021-00333-y"}

{"title": "A Review of AI-Based Radiomics and Computational Pathology Approaches in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Current Applications and Perspectives.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. Approximately, 20% of all breast cancers are characterized as triple negative (TNBC). TNBC typically is associated with a poorer prognosis relative to other breast cancer subtypes. Due to its aggressiveness and lack of response to hormonal therapy, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is the usual treatment; however, this treatment is not always effective, and an important percentage of patients develop recurrence. More recently, immunotherapy has started to be used on some populations with TNBC showing promising results. Unfortunately, immunotherapy is only applicable to a minority of patients and responses in metastatic TNBC have overall been modest in comparison to other cancer types. This situation evidences the need for developing effective biomarkers that help to stratify and personalize patient management. Thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), there has been an increasing interest in its use for medical applications aiming at supporting clinical decision making. Several works have used AI in combination with diagnostic medical imaging, more specifically radiology and digitized histopathological tissue samples, aiming to extract disease-specific information that is difficult to quantify by the human eye. These works have demonstrated that analysis of such images in the context of TNBC has great potential for (1) risk-stratifying patients to identify those patients who are more likely to experience disease recurrence or die from the disease and (2) predicting pathologic complete response. In this manuscript, we present an overview on AI and its integration with radiology and histopathological images for developing prognostic and predictive approaches for TNBC. We present state of the art approaches in the literature and discuss the opportunities and challenges with developing AI algorithms regarding further development and clinical deployment, including identifying those patients who may benefit from certain treatments (e.g., adjuvant chemotherapy) from those who may not and thereby should be directed toward other therapies, discovering potential differences between populations, and identifying disease subtypes.", "journal": "Clinical breast cancer", "date": "2023-06-29", "authors": ["Germ\u00e1nCorredor", "SatvikaBharadwaj", "TilakPathak", "Vidya SankarViswanathan", "PaulaToro", "AnantMadabhushi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clbc.2023.06.004\n10.3389/fgene.2021.783513\n10.3389/fonc.2020.00412"}

We used neuropsychological testing and questionnaire to evaluate psychiatric comorbidity, cognitive dysfunction as well as generalized sampling imaging (GQI) and graph theoretical analysis (GTA) to detect microstructural alterations in the brain.\nCross-comparison between groups revealed that neurotoxicity caused by chemotherapy and cancer-related psychiatric comorbidity may affect the corpus callosum and middle frontal gyrus. In addition, GQI indices were correlated with the testing scores of cognitive function, quality of life, anxiety, and depression.

{"title": "Differentiation between Phyllodes Tumors and Fibroadenomas through Breast Ultrasound: Deep-Learning Model Outperforms Ultrasound Physicians.", "abstract": "The preoperative differentiation of breast phyllodes tumors (PTs) from fibroadenomas (FAs) plays a critical role in identifying an appropriate surgical treatment. Although several imaging modalities are available, reliable differentiation between PT and FA remains a great challenge for radiologists in clinical work. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis has shown promise in distinguishing PT from FA. However, a very small sample size was adopted in previous studies. In this work, we retrospectively enrolled 656 breast tumors (372 FAs and 284 PTs) with 1945 ultrasound images in total. Two experienced ultrasound physicians independently evaluated the ultrasound images. Meanwhile, three deep-learning models (i.e., ResNet, VGG, and GoogLeNet) were applied to classify FAs and PTs. The robustness of the models was evaluated by fivefold cross validation. The performance of each model was assessed by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also calculated. Among the three models, the ResNet model yielded the highest AUC value, of 0.91, with an accuracy value of 95.3%, a sensitivity value of 96.2%, and a specificity value of 94.7% in the testing data set. In contrast, the two physicians yielded an average AUC value of 0.69, an accuracy value of 70.7%, a sensitivity value of 54.4%, and a specificity value of 53.2%. Our findings indicate that the diagnostic performance of deep learning is better than that of physicians in the distinction of PTs from FAs.

Radiological in vivo techniques may allow receptor status tracking at high frequencies at low risk and cost. The present study aims to investigate the potential of receptor status prediction through machine-learning-based analysis of radiomic MR image features. The analysis is based on 412 brain metastases samples from 106 patients acquired between 09/2007 and 09/2021. Inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosed cerebral metastases from breast cancer; histopathology reports on progesterone (PR), estrogen (ER), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor status; and availability of MR imaging data. In total, 3367 quantitative features of T1 contrast-enhanced, T1 non-enhanced, and FLAIR images and corresponding patient age were evaluated utilizing random forest algorithms. Feature importance was assessed using Gini impurity measures. Predictive performance was tested using 10 permuted 5-fold cross-validation sets employing the 30 most important features of each training set. Receiver operating characteristic areas under the curves of the validation sets were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [0.78; 0.85]) for ER+, 0.73 [0.69; 0.77] for PR+, and 0.74 [0.70; 0.78] for HER2+.

We defined an anomaly score as the deviation of an observed CE-MRI scan from the model of normal breast tissue variability. We evaluated the anomaly score's association with future lesion emergence on the level of local image patches (104,531 normal patches, 455 patches of future lesion location) and entire CE-MRI exams (21 normal, 20 with future lesion). Associations were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on the patch level and logistic regression on the examination level.\nThe local anomaly score on image patches was a good predictor for future lesion emergence (area under the ROC curve 0.804).

{"title": "Emerging uses of artificial intelligence in breast and axillary ultrasound.", "abstract": "Breast ultrasound is a valuable adjunctive tool to mammography in detecting breast cancer, especially in women with dense breasts. Ultrasound also plays an important role in staging breast cancer by assessing axillary lymph nodes. However, its utility is limited by operator dependence, high recall rate, low positive predictive value and low specificity. These limitations present an opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve diagnostic performance and pioneer novel uses of ultrasound. Research in developing AI for radiology has flourished over the past few years. A subset of AI, deep learning, uses interconnected computational nodes to form a neural network, which extracts complex visual features from image data to train itself into a predictive model. This review summarizes several key studies evaluating AI programs' performance in predicting breast cancer and demonstrates that AI can assist radiologists and address limitations of ultrasound by acting as a decision support tool. This review also touches on how AI programs allow for novel predictive uses of ultrasound, particularly predicting molecular subtypes of breast cancer and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which have the potential to change how breast cancer is managed by providing non-invasive prognostic and treatment data from ultrasound images.

{"title": "A divide and conquer approach to maximise deep learning mammography classification accuracies.", "abstract": "Breast cancer claims 11,400 lives on average every year in the UK, making it one of the deadliest diseases. Mammography is the gold standard for detecting early signs of breast cancer, which can help cure the disease during its early stages. However, incorrect mammography diagnoses are common and may harm patients through unnecessary treatments and operations (or a lack of treatment). Therefore, systems that can learn to detect breast cancer on their own could help reduce the number of incorrect interpretations and missed cases. Various deep learning techniques, which can be used to implement a system that learns how to detect instances of breast cancer in mammograms, are explored throughout this paper. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are used as part of a pipeline based on deep learning techniques. A divide and conquer approach is followed to analyse the effects on performance and efficiency when utilising diverse deep learning techniques such as varying network architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2), class weights, input sizes, image ratios, pre-processing techniques, transfer learning, dropout rates, and types of mammogram projections. This approach serves as a starting point for model development of mammography classification tasks. Practitioners can benefit from this work by using the divide and conquer results to select the most suitable deep learning techniques for their case out-of-the-box, thus reducing the need for extensive exploratory experimentation. Multiple techniques are found to provide accuracy gains relative to a general baseline (VGG19 model using uncropped 512 \u00d7 512 pixels input images with a dropout rate of 0.2 and a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10-3) on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) dataset. These techniques involve transfer learning pre-trained ImagetNet weights to a MobileNetV2 architecture, with pre-trained weights from a binarised version of the mini Mammography Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) dataset applied to the fully connected layers of the model, coupled with using weights to alleviate class imbalance, and splitting CBIS-DDSM samples between images of masses and calcifications. Using these techniques, a 5.6% gain in accuracy over the baseline model was accomplished.

{"title": "Standalone AI for Breast Cancer Detection at Screening Digital Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.", "abstract": "Background There is considerable interest in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in mammographic screening. However, it is essential to critically evaluate the performance of AI before it can become a modality used for independent mammographic interpretation. Purpose To evaluate the reported standalone performances of AI for interpretation of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published from January 2017 to June 2022. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were reviewed. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and Comparative (QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C, respectively). A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed for overall studies and for different study types (reader studies vs historic cohort studies) and imaging techniques (digital mammography vs DBT). Results In total, 16 studies that include 1\u2009108\u2009328 examinations in 497\u2009091 women were analyzed (six reader studies, seven historic cohort studies on digital mammography, and four studies on DBT).

{"title": "Radiomic and clinical data integration using machine learning predict the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies-based combinational treatment in advanced breast cancer: a multicentered study.", "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-based therapy, is regarded as one of the major breakthroughs in cancer treatment. However, it is challenging to accurately identify patients who may benefit from ICIs. Current biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of ICIs require pathological slides, and their accuracy is limited. Here we aim to develop a radiomics model that could accurately predict response of ICIs for patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC).\nPretreatment contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) image and clinicopathological features of 240 patients with ABC who underwent ICIs-based treatment in three academic hospitals from February 2018 to January 2022 were assigned into a training cohort and an independent validation cohort. For radiomic features extraction, CECT images of patients 1\u2009month prior to ICIs-based therapies were first delineated with regions of interest. Data dimension reduction, feature selection and radiomics model construction were carried out with multilayer perceptron. Combined the radiomics signatures with independent clinicopathological characteristics, the model was integrated by multivariable logistic regression analysis.\nAmong the 240 patients, 171 from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were evaluated as a training cohort, while other 69 from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were the validation cohort. The area under the curve (AUC) of radiomics model was 0.994 (95% CI: 0.988 to 1.000) in the training and 0.920 (95% CI: 0.824 to 1.000) in the validation set, respectively, which were significantly better than the performance of clinical model (0.672 for training and 0.634 for validation set). The integrated clinical-radiomics model showed increased but not statistical different predictive ability in both the training (AUC=0.997, 95%\u2009CI: 0.993 to 1.000) and validation set (AUC=0.961, 95%\u2009CI: 0.885 to 1.000) compared with the radiomics model. Furthermore, the radiomics model could divide patients under ICIs-therapies into high-risk and low-risk group with significantly different progression-free survival both in training (HR=2.705, 95%\u2009CI: 1.888 to 3.876, p<0.001) and validation set (HR=2.625, 95%\u2009CI: 1.506 to 4.574, p=0.001), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the radiomics model was not influenced by programmed death-ligand 1 status, tumor metastatic burden or molecular subtype.\nThis radiomics model provided an innovative and accurate way that could stratify patients with ABC who may benefit more from ICIs-based therapies.", "journal": "Journal for immunotherapy of cancer", "date": "2023-05-23", "authors": ["JianliZhao", "ZhixianSun", "YunfangYu", "ZhongyuYuan", "YingLin", "YujieTan", "XiaohuiDuan", "HeruiYao", "YingWang", "JieqiongLiu"], "doi": "10.1136/jitc-2022-006514\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.1007/s11427-018-9396-x\n10.1056/NEJMoa1910549\n10.1056/NEJMoa2202809\n10.1056/NEJMc1713444\n10.1200/JCO.20.02923\n10.1093/annonc/mdz158\n10.1148/radiol.2015151169\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141\n10.1093/annonc/mdz108\n10.1016/j.lungcan.2019.01.010\n10.1007/s00259-019-04625-9\n10.1136/jitc-2020-000696\n10.1038/s41467-022-30569-0\n10.1016/j.ejca.2008.10.026\n10.1080/2162402X.2022.2028962\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0339\n10.1148/radiol.2020191145\n10.1186/s12967-022-03688-x\n10.1136/jitc-2020-000550\n10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30413-3"}

We aimed to assess cancer treatment regimens given by CSCO AI and different levels of clinicians.\n400 breast cancer patients were screened from the CSCO database. Clinicians with similar levels were randomly assigned one of the volumes (200 cases). CSCO AI was asked to assess all cases. Three reviewers were independently asked to evaluate the regimens from clinicians and CSCO AI. Regimens were masked before evaluation. The primary outcome was the proportion of high-level conformity (HLC).\nThe overall concordance between clinicians and CSCO AI was 73.9% (3621/4900). It was 78.8% (2757/3500) in the early-stage, higher than that in the metastatic stage (61.7% [864/1400], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The concordance was 90.7% (635/700) and 56.4% (395/700) in adjuvant radiotherapy and second-line therapy respectively. HLC in CSCO AI was 95.8% (95%CI:94.0%-97.6%), significantly higher than that in clinicians (90.8%, 95%CI:89.8%-91.8%).

While HER2-targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings, including for parenchymal brain metastases, their efficacy for patients with LM has not been studied in a randomized controlled trial. However, several single-armed prospective studies, case series and case reports have studied oral, intravenous, or intrathecally administered HER2-targeted therapy regimens for patients with HER2+ BC LM.\nWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data to evaluate the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies in HER2+ BC LM in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Targeted therapies evaluated were trastuzumab (intrathecal or intravenous), pertuzumab, lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib, trastuzumab-emtansine and trastuzumab-deruxtecan. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), with CNS-specific progression-free survival (PFS) as a secondary endpoint.\n7780 abstracts were screened, identifying 45 publications with 208 patients, corresponding to 275 lines of HER2-targeted therapy for BC LM which met inclusion criteria. In univariable and multivariable analyses, we observed no significant difference in OS and CNS-specific PFS between intrathecal trastuzumab compared to oral or intravenous administration of HER2-targeted therapy. Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody-based regimens did not demonstrate superiority over HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In a cohort of 15 patients, treatment with trastuzumab-deruxtecan was associated with prolonged OS compared to other HER2-targeted therapies and compared to trastuzumab-emtansine.\nThe results of this meta-analysis, comprising the limited data available, suggest that intrathecal administration of HER2-targeted therapy for patients with HER2+ BC LM confers no additional benefit over oral and/or IV treatment regimens.

{"title": "A deep learning approach for automatic delineation of clinical target volume in stereotactic partial breast irradiation (S-PBI).", "abstract": "Accurate and efficient delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) is of utmost significance in post-operative breast cancer radiotherapy. However, CTV delineation is challenging as the exact extent of microscopic disease encompassed by CTV is not visualizable in radiological images and remains uncertain. We proposed to mimic physicians' contouring practice for CTV segmentation in stereotactic partial breast irradiation (S-PBI) where CTV is derived from tumor bed volume (TBV) via a margin expansion followed by correcting the extensions for anatomical barriers of tumor invasion (e.g. skin, chest wall). We proposed a deep-learning model, where CT images and the corresponding TBV masks formed a multi-channel input for a 3D U-Net based architecture. The design guided the model to encode the location-related image features and directed the network to focus on TBV to initiate CTV segmentation. Gradient weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM) visualizations of the model predictions revealed that the extension rules and geometric/anatomical boundaries were learnt during model training to assist the network to limit the expansion to a certain distance from the chest wall and the skin. We retrospectively collected 175 prone CT images from 35 post-operative breast cancer patients who received 5-fraction partial breast irradiation regimen on GammaPod. The 35 patients were randomly split into training (25), validation (5) and test (5) sets. Our model achieved mean (standard deviation) of 0.94 (\u00b10.02), 2.46 (\u00b10.5) mm, and 0.53 (\u00b10.14) mm for Dice similarity coefficient, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, and average symmetric surface distance respectively on the test set.

However, it also leads to immune-related adverse events (iRAEs), which result in multiple organ damage. Among them, the most common one with the highest mortality in NSCLC patients treated with ICI is checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP). The respiratory signs of CIP are highly coincident and overlap with those in primary lung cancer, which causes difficulties in detecting, diagnosing, managing, and treating. In clinical management, patients with serious CIP should receive immunosuppressive treatment and even discontinue immunotherapy, which impairs the clinical benefits of ICIs and potentially results in tumor recrudesce. Therefore, accurate diagnosis, detailedly dissecting the pathogenesis, and developing reasonable treatment strategies for CIP are essential to prolong patient survival and expand the application of ICI. Herein, we first summarized the diagnosis strategies of CIP in NSCLC, including the classical radiology examination and the rising serological test, pathology test, and artificial intelligence aids. Then, we dissected the potential pathogenic mechanisms of CIP, including disordered T cell subsets, the increase of autoantibodies, cross-antigens reactivity, and the potential role of other immune cells. Moreover, we explored therapeutic approaches beyond first-line steroid therapy and future direction based on targeted signaling pathways.

Ultrasound is a widely used screening tool for its portability and easy operation, and DCE-MRI can highlight the lesions more clearly and reveal the characteristics of tumors. They are both noninvasive and nonradiative for assessment of breast cancer. Doctors make diagnoses and further instructions through the sizes, shapes and textures of the breast masses showed on medical images, so automatic tumor segmentation via deep neural networks can to some extent assist doctors. Compared to some challenges which the popular deep neural networks have faced, such as large amounts of parameters, lack of interpretability, overfitting problem, etc., we propose a segmentation network named Att-U-Node which uses attention modules to guide a neural ODE-based framework, trying to alleviate the problems mentioned above. Specifically, the network uses ODE blocks to make up an encoder-decoder structure, feature modeling by neural ODE is completed at each level. Besides, we propose to use an attention module to calculate the coefficient and generate a much refined attention feature for skip connection. Three public available breast ultrasound image datasets (i.e. BUSI, BUS and OASBUD) and a private breast DCE-MRI dataset are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed model, besides, we upgrade the model to 3D for tumor segmentation with the data selected from Public QIN Breast DCE-MRI.

{"title": "DeepMiCa: Automatic segmentation and classification of breast MIcroCAlcifications from mammograms.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the world's most prevalent form of cancer. The survival rates have increased in the last years mainly due to factors such as screening programs for early detection, new insights on the disease mechanisms as well as personalised treatments. Microcalcifications are the only first detectable sign of breast cancer and diagnosis timing is strongly related to the chances of survival. Nevertheless microcalcifications detection and classification as benign or malignant lesions is still a challenging clinical task and their malignancy can only be proven after a biopsy procedure. We propose DeepMiCa, a fully automated and visually explainable deep-learning based pipeline for the analysis of raw mammograms with microcalcifications. Our aim is to propose a reliable decision support system able to guide the diagnosis and help the clinicians to better inspect borderline difficult cases.\nDeepMiCa is composed by three main steps: (1) Preprocessing of the raw scans (2) Automatic patch-based Semantic Segmentation using a UNet based network with a custom loss function appositely designed to deal with extremely small lesions (3) Classification of the detected lesions with a deep transfer-learning approach. Finally, state-of-the-art explainable AI methods are used to produce maps for a visual interpretation of the classification results. Each step of DeepMiCa is designed to address the main limitations of the previous proposed works resulting in a novel automated and accurate pipeline easily customisable to meet radiologists' needs.\nThe proposed segmentation and classification algorithms achieve an area under the ROC curve of 0.95 and 0.89 respectively. Compared to previously proposed works, this method does not require high performance computational resources and provides a visual explanation of the final classification results.\nTo conclude, we designed a novel fully automated pipeline for detection and classification of breast microcalcifications. We believe that the proposed system has the potential to provide a second opinion in the diagnosis process giving the clinicians the opportunity to quickly visualise and inspect relevant imaging characteristics. In the clinical practice the proposed decision support system could help reduce the rate of misclassified lesions and consequently the number of unnecessary biopsies.", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "date": "2023-04-09", "authors": ["AlessiaGerbasi", "GretaClementi", "FabioCorsi", "SaraAlbasini", "AlbertoMalovini", "SilvanaQuaglini", "RiccardoBellazzi"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2023.107483"}

Pathologic findings of surgical specimens were used as the gold standard to classify tumor regression patterns into concentric and non-concentric shrinkage. Morphologic and kinetic MRI features were both analyzed. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to select the key clinicopathologic and MRI features for pretreatment prediction of regression pattern. Logistic regression and six machine learning methods were used to construct prediction models, and their performance were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curve.\nTwo clinicopathologic variables and three MRI features were selected as independent predictors to construct prediction models.

The logistic regression model yielded an AUC of 0.708 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.658-0.759), and the decision tree model achieved the highest AUC of 0.740 (95% CI: 0.691-0.787). For internal validation, the optimism-corrected AUCs of seven models were in the range of 0.592-0.684. There was no significant difference between the AUCs of the logistic regression model and that of each machine learning model.\nPrediction models combining pretreatment MRI and clinicopathologic features are useful for predicting tumor regression pattern in breast cancer, which can assist to select patients who can benefit from NAC for de-escalation of breast surgery and modify treatment strategy.", "journal": "Academic radiology", "date": "2023-04-06", "authors": ["ChenLiu", "XiaomeiHuang", "XiaoboChen", "ZhenweiShi", "ChunlingLiu", "YantingLiang", "XinHuang", "MingleiChen", "XinChen", "ChanghongLiang", "ZaiyiLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acra.2023.02.024"}

VBrain by Vysioneer Inc. is a deep learning algorithm with recent FDA clearance to assist in brain tumor contouring. We aimed to assess the performance of this tool by various demographic and clinical characteristics among patients with brain metastases treated with SRS.\nWe randomly selected 100 patients with brain metastases who underwent initial SRS on the CyberKnife from 2017 to 2020 at a single institution. Cases with resection cavities were excluded from the analysis. Computed tomography (CT) and axial T1-weighted post-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) image data were extracted for each patient and uploaded to VBrain. A brain metastasis was considered \"detected\" when the VBrain- \"predicted\" contours overlapped with the corresponding physician contours (\"ground-truth\" contours). We evaluated performance of VBrain against ground-truth contours using the following metrics: lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), lesion-wise average Hausdorff distance (AVD), false positive count (FP), and lesion-wise sensitivity (%). Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to assess the relationships between patient characteristics including sex, race, primary histology, age, and size and number of brain metastases, and performance metrics such as DSC, AVD, FP, and sensitivity.\nWe analyzed 100 patients with 435 intact brain metastases treated with SRS. Our cohort consisted of patients with a median number of 2 brain metastases (range: 1 to 52), median age of 69 (range: 19 to 91), and 50% male and 50% female patients. The primary site breakdown was 56% lung, 10% melanoma, 9% breast, 8% gynecological, 5% renal, 4% gastrointestinal, 2% sarcoma, and 6% other, while the race breakdown was 60% White, 18% Asian, 3% Black/African American, 2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and 17% other/unknown/not reported. The median tumor size was 0.112 c.c. (range: 0.010-26.475 c.c.). We found mean lesion-wise DSC to be 0.723, mean lesion-wise AVD to be 7.34% of lesion size (0.704\u00a0mm), mean FP count to be 0.72 tumors per case, and lesion-wise sensitivity to be 89.30% for all lesions. Moreover, mean sensitivity was found to be 99.07%, 97.59%, and 96.23% for lesions with diameter equal to and greater than 10\u00a0mm, 7.5\u00a0mm, and 5\u00a0mm, respectively. No other significant differences in performance metrics were observed across demographic or clinical characteristic groups.\nIn this study, a commercial deep learning algorithm showed promising results in segmenting brain metastases, with 96.23% sensitivity for metastases with diameters of 5\u00a0mm or higher.

{"title": "Acute coronary event (ACE) prediction following breast radiotherapy by features extracted from 3D CT, dose, and cardiac structures.", "abstract": "Heart toxicity, such as major acute coronary events (ACE), following breast radiation therapy (RT) is of utmost concern. Thus, many studies have been investigating the effect of mean heart dose (MHD) and dose received in heart sub-structures on toxicity. Most studies focused on the dose thresholds in the heart and its sub-structures, while few studies adopted such computational methods as deep neural networks (DNN) and radiomics. This work aims to construct a feature-driven predictive model for ACE after breast RT.\nA recently proposed two-step predictive model that extracts a number of features from a deep auto-segmentation network and processes the selected features for prediction was adopted. This work refined the auto-segmenting network and feature processing algorithms to enhance performance in cardiac toxicity prediction. In the predictive model, the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) extracted features from 3D computed tomography (CT) images and dose distributions in three automatically segmented heart sub-structures, including the left anterior descending artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), and left ventricle (LV). The optimal feature processing workflow for the extracted features was explored to enhance the prediction accuracy. The regions associated with toxicity were visualized using a class activation map (CAM)-based technique. Our proposed model was validated against a conventional DNN (convolutional and fully connected layers) and radiomics with a patient cohort of 84 cases, including 29 and 55 patient cases with and without ACE. Of the entire 84 cases, 12 randomly chosen cases (5 toxicity and 7 non-toxicity cases) were set aside for independent test, and the remaining 72 cases were applied to 4-fold stratified cross-validation.\nOur predictive model outperformed the conventional DNN by 38% and 10% and radiomics-based predictive models by 9% and 10% in AUC for 4-fold cross-validations and independent test, respectively. The degree of enhancement was greater when incorporating dose information and heart sub-structures into feature extraction. The model whose inputs were CT, dose, and three sub-structures (LV, LAD, and RCA) reached 96% prediction accuracy on average and 0.94 area under the curve (AUC) on average in the cross-validation, and also achieved prediction accuracy of 83% and AUC of 0.83 in the independent test. On 10 correctly predicted cases out of 12 for the independent test, the activation maps implied that for cases of ACE toxicity, the higher intensity was more likely to be observed inside the LV.\nThe proposed model characterized by modifications in model input with dose distributions and cardiac sub-structures, and serial processing of feature extraction and feature selection techniques can improve the predictive performance in ACE following breast RT.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2023-03-29", "authors": ["Byong SuChoi", "Sang KyunYoo", "JinyoungMoon", "Seung YeunChung", "JaewonOh", "StephenBaek", "YusungKim", "Jee SukChang", "HojinKim", "Jin SungKim"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.16398"}

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging data from 479 breast cancer patients with 488 lesions were studied. The included patients were divided into two cohorts by time (training/testing cohort, n\u2009=\u2009366/122). Deep learning features were extracted from diffusion-weighted imaging-quantitatively measured apparent diffusion coefficient (DWI-ADC) imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) by a pretrained neural network of DenseNet121. After the selection of both radiomic and clinicopathological features, deep learning signature and a nomogram were built for independent validation. Twenty-three deep learning features were automatically selected in the training cohort to establish the deep learning signature of ALNM. Three clinicopathological factors, including LN palpability (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20096.04; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20093.06-12.54, P\u2009=\u20090.004), tumor size in MRI (OR\u2009=\u20091.45, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.18-1.80, P\u2009=\u20090.104), and Ki-67 (OR\u2009=\u20091.01; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.00-1.02, P\u2009=\u20090.099), were selected and combined with radiomic signature to build a combined nomogram. The nomogram showed excellent predictive ability for ALNM (AUC 0.80 and 0.71 in training and testing cohorts, respectively).

Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) are considered to be the models that best represent human disease and have high translational value. Notably, one element of co-clinical trials that still needs significant optimization is quantitative imaging.

Several studies have suggested that the clinical implementation of automated contouring tools can reduce inter-observer variation while increasing contouring efficiency, thereby improving the quality of radiotherapy treatment and reducing the time between simulation and treatment. In this study, a novel, commercial automated contouring tool based on machine learning, the AI-Rad Companion Organs RT\u2122 (AI-Rad) software (Version VA31) (Siemens Healthineers, Munich, Germany), was assessed against both manually delineated contours and another commercially available automated contouring software, Varian Smart Segmentation\u2122 (SS) (Version 16.0) (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, United States). The quality of contours generated by AI-Rad in Head and Neck (H&N), Thorax, Breast, Male Pelvis (Pelvis_M), and Female Pelvis (Pevis_F) anatomical areas was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively using several metrics. A timing analysis was subsequently performed to explore potential time savings achieved by AI-Rad. Results showed that most automated contours generated by AI-Rad were not only clinically acceptable and required minimal editing, but also superior in quality to contours generated by SS in multiple structures. In addition, timing analysis favored AI-Rad over manual contouring, indicating the largest time saving (753s per patient) in the Thorax area.

{"title": "Targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy: An approach to tackle resistance in cancer cells.", "abstract": "Modern cancer chemotherapy originated in the 1940s, and since then, many chemotherapeutic agents have been developed. However, most of these agents show limited response in patients due to innate and acquired resistance to therapy, which leads to the development of multi-drug resistance to different treatment modalities, leading to cancer recurrence and, eventually, patient death. One of the crucial players in inducing chemotherapy resistance is the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme. ALDH is overexpressed in chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells, which detoxifies the generated toxic aldehydes from chemotherapy, preventing the formation of reactive oxygen species and, thus, inhibiting the induction of oxidative stress and the stimulation of DNA damage and cell death. This review discusses the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in cancer cells promoted by ALDH. In addition, we provide detailed insight into the role of ALDH in cancer stemness, metastasis, metabolism, and cell death. Several studies investigated targeting ALDH in combination with other treatments as a potential therapeutic regimen to overcome resistance. We also highlight novel approaches in ALDH inhibition, including the potential synergistic employment of ALDH inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy against different cancers, including head and neck, colorectal, breast, lung, and liver.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2023-03-05", "authors": ["Salma AAl-Shamma", "Dana MZaher", "FatemaHersi", "Nour NAbu Jayab", "Hany AOmar"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2023.121541"}
{"title": "Molecular and functional imaging in cancer-targeted therapy: current applications and future directions.", "abstract": "Targeted anticancer drugs block cancer cell growth by interfering with specific signaling pathways vital to carcinogenesis and tumor growth rather than harming all rapidly dividing cells as in cytotoxic chemotherapy. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) system has been used to assess tumor response to therapy via changes in the size of target lesions as measured by calipers, conventional anatomically based imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other imaging methods. However, RECIST is sometimes inaccurate in assessing the efficacy of targeted therapy drugs because of the poor correlation between tumor size and treatment-induced tumor necrosis or shrinkage. This approach might also result in delayed identification of response when the therapy does confer a reduction in tumor size. Innovative molecular imaging techniques have rapidly gained importance in the dawning era of targeted therapy as they can visualize, characterize, and quantify biological processes at the cellular, subcellular, or even molecular level rather than at the anatomical level. This review summarizes different targeted cell signaling pathways, various molecular imaging techniques, and developed probes. Moreover, the application of molecular imaging for evaluating treatment response and related clinical outcome is also systematically outlined. In the future, more attention should be paid to promoting the clinical translation of molecular imaging in evaluating the sensitivity to targeted therapy with biocompatible probes.

{"title": "How Radiomics Can Improve Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment.", "abstract": "Recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence hold promise in addressing medical challenges in breast cancer care, such as early diagnosis, cancer subtype determination and molecular profiling, prediction of lymph node metastases, and prognostication of treatment response and probability of recurrence. Radiomics is a quantitative approach to medical imaging, which aims to enhance the existing data available to clinicians by means of advanced mathematical analysis using artificial intelligence. Various published studies from different fields in imaging have highlighted the potential of radiomics to enhance clinical decision making. In this review, we describe the evolution of AI in breast imaging and its frontiers, focusing on handcrafted and deep learning radiomics. We present a typical workflow of a radiomics analysis and a practical \"how-to\" guide. Finally, we summarize the methodology and implementation of radiomics in breast cancer, based on the most recent scientific literature to help researchers and clinicians gain fundamental knowledge of this emerging technology. Alongside this, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics and challenges of integration into clinical practice with conceptual consistency, data curation, technical reproducibility, adequate accuracy, and clinical translation. The incorporation of radiomics with clinical, histopathological, and genomic information will enable physicians to move forward to a higher level of personalized management of patients with breast cancer.", "journal": "Journal of clinical medicine", "date": "2023-02-26", "authors": ["FilippoPesapane", "PaoloDe Marco", "AnnaRapino", "EleonoraLombardo", "LucaNicosia", "PriyanTantrige", "AnnaRotili", "Anna CarlaBozzini", "SilviaPenco", "ValeriaDominelli", "ChiaraTrentin", "FedericaFerrari", "MariagiorgiaFarina", "LorenzaMeneghetti", "AntuonoLatronico", "FrancescaAbbate", "DanielaOriggi", "GianpaoloCarrafiello", "EnricoCassano"], "doi": "10.3390/jcm12041372\n10.1148/rg.2018180047\n10.6004/jnccn.2018.0012\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-15-0578\n10.1016/j.breast.2019.10.018\n10.18632/oncotarget.8431\n10.1007/s10549-019-05519-y\n10.3390/jcm11216553\n10.3390/curroncol28040217\n10.2214/AJR.18.20389\n10.1186/s41747-018-0061-6\n10.1259/bjr.20170576\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000358\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-0853\n10.1016/j.jvir.2018.01.769\n10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2022.100883\n10.3390/ijms232315322\n10.3390/cancers13174271\n10.1093/bjs/znac391\n10.1007/s12032-020-01353-1\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.10.009\n10.1038/s41523-017-0045-3\n10.1007/s13244-012-0196-6\n10.1038/ncomms5006\n10.1016/j.nicl.2016.02.012\n10.1007/s12032-017-0892-7\n10.2217/fon-2017-0655\n10.1148/radiol.12120167\n10.1002/nbm.2882\n10.1007/s11547-022-01561-x\n10.1016/j.breast.2020.06.005\n10.1007/s12032-020-01358-w\n10.1056/NEJMoa1903986\n10.1200/JCO.2009.23.0839\n10.3390/cancers14174337\n10.1148/radiol.14130569\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000222\n10.1148/radiol.2016160261\n10.1038/npjbcancer.2016.12\n10.1016/j.acra.2009.08.012\n10.1371/journal.pone.0143308\n10.1371/journal.pone.0171683\n10.1038/srep17787\n10.1002/jmri.1125\n10.1007/s00330-017-5005-7\n10.1002/jmri.25606\n10.1148/radiol.2016152110\n10.1007/s12094-016-1526-9\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.06.019\n10.1002/jmri.26981\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00980\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3783\n10.1016/j.clbc.2017.08.002\n10.1007/s00259-017-3770-9\n10.1002/cam4.2711\n10.1007/s12194-019-00543-5\n10.1148/radiol.2493081301\n10.2214/AJR.10.4208\n10.1016/j.breast.2009.01.001\n10.1007/s10549-011-1847-x\n10.1016/S0033-8389(01)00011-2\n10.1186/s13244-019-0803-x\n10.1118/1.2335487\n10.1186/s41747-018-0068-z\n10.1016/j.phro.2022.05.006\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000530\n10.1186/s13244-020-00887-2\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2022.06.012\n10.1016/j.radonc.2007.12.025\n10.1007/s12194-017-0406-5\n10.7326/M14-0697\n10.1016/j.clinimag.2018.08.014\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2021.109882\n10.1002/jmri.26878\n10.1200/JCO.2005.00.695\n10.1148/ryai.2020200029\n10.1259/bjr.20220569\n10.1007/s13244-018-0645-y\n10.6004/jnccn.2018.0083\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00505\n10.1148/radiol.2017170273\n10.1148/radiol.2019181113\n10.1016/j.breast.2018.04.016\n10.1038/s41598-019-48488-4\n10.1007/s00330-018-5804-5\n10.1371/journal.pone.0234871\n10.2147/CMAR.S174435\n10.3747/co.25.3729\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3190\n10.1007/s12094-019-02109-8\n10.1186/s40644-018-0145-9\n10.1007/s10549-018-4990-9\n10.1002/nbm.3132\n10.1186/s13058-017-0846-1\n10.1016/j.acra.2020.10.020\n10.1002/jmri.23971\n10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30380-2\n10.1016/j.surg.2013.07.017\n10.1259/bjr.20191019\n10.1038/s41598-019-40831-z\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.28086\n10.1007/s00330-020-07016-z\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103460\n10.1186/s42492-022-00104-5\n10.1056/NEJMoa020128\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-4067\n10.1002/jmri.26648\n10.3390/tomography8020049\n10.3389/fonc.2021.621993\n10.1259/bjr.20210188\n10.18632/oncotarget.28139\n10.1259/bjr.20210348\n10.21037/cco.2019.12.02\n10.1038/ng.2764\n10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30413-3"}
{"title": "Adherence to Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients.", "abstract": "Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) reduces breast cancer recurrence and mortality of women with hormone-receptor-positive tumors, but poor adherence remains a significant problem. The aim of this study was to analyze AET side effects and their impact on adherence to treatment.\nA total of 373 breast cancer patients treated with AET filled out a specific questionnaire during their follow up visits at the Breast Unit of our Centre.\nSide effects were reported by 81% of patients, 84% of those taking tamoxifen and 80% of those taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs). The most common side effect in the tamoxifen group was hot flashes (55.6%), while in the AI group it was arthralgia (60.6%). The addition of GnRH agonists to both tamoxifen and AI significantly worsened all menopausal symptoms.

However, the potential of immune cells' specific genes-based model remains largely unknown. In the current study, by analysing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and bulk RNA sequencing data, the tumour-infiltrating immune cell (TIIC) associated signature was developed based on a total of 26 machine learning (ML) algorithms. As a result, the TIIC signature score could predict survival outcomes of LUAD patients across five independent datasets. The TIIC signature score showed superior performance to 168 previously established signatures in LUAD. Moreover, the TIIC signature score developed by the immunofluorescence staining of the tissue array of LUAD patients showed a prognostic value. Our research revealed a solid connection between TIIC signature score and tumour immunity as well as metabolism. Additionally, it has been discovered that the TIIC signature score can forecast genomic change, chemotherapeutic drug susceptibility, and-most significantly-immunotherapeutic response. As a newly demonstrated biomarker, the TIIC signature score facilitated the selection of the LUAD population who would benefit from future clinical stratification.", "journal": "Cell proliferation", "date": "2023-02-24", "authors": ["NanZhang", "HaoZhang", "ZaoquLiu", "ZiyuDai", "WantaoWu", "RanZhou", "ShuyuLi", "ZeyuWang", "XisongLiang", "JieWen", "XunZhang", "BoZhang", "SiruiOuyang", "JianZhang", "PengLuo", "XizheLi", "QuanCheng"], "doi": "10.1111/cpr.13409"}

This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art applications of DL models in breast MRI. Many recent DL models were examined in this field, along with several advanced learning approaches and methods for data normalization and breast and lesion segmentation.

{"title": "Predicting gene mutation status via artificial intelligence technologies based on multimodal integration (MMI) to advance precision oncology.", "abstract": "Personalized treatment strategies for cancer frequently rely on the detection of genetic alterations which are determined by molecular biology assays. Historically, these processes typically required single-gene sequencing, next-generation sequencing, or visual inspection of histopathology slides by experienced pathologists in a clinical context. In the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have demonstrated remarkable potential in assisting physicians with accurate diagnosis of oncology image-recognition tasks. Meanwhile, AI techniques make it possible to integrate multimodal data such as radiology, histology, and genomics, providing critical guidance for the stratification of patients in the context of precision therapy. Given that the mutation detection is unaffordable and time-consuming for a considerable number of patients, predicting gene mutations based on routine clinical radiological scans or whole-slide images of tissue with AI-based methods has become a hot issue in actual clinical practice. In this review, we synthesized the general framework of multimodal integration (MMI) for molecular intelligent diagnostics beyond standard techniques. Then we summarized the emerging applications of AI in the prediction of mutational and molecular profiles of common cancers (lung, brain, breast, and other tumor types) pertaining to radiology and histology imaging. Furthermore, we concluded that there truly exist multiple challenges of AI techniques in the way of its real-world application in the medical field, including data curation, feature fusion, model interpretability, and practice regulations.

{"title": "Raman spectroscopy and convolutional neural networks for monitoring biochemical radiation response in breast tumour xenografts.", "abstract": "Tumour cells exhibit altered metabolic pathways that lead to radiation resistance and disease progression. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a label-free optical modality that can monitor post-irradiation biomolecular signatures in tumour cells and tissues. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) perform automated feature extraction directly from data, with classification accuracy exceeding that of traditional machine learning, in cases where data is abundant and feature extraction is challenging. We are interested in developing a CNN-based predictive model to characterize clinical tumour response to radiation therapy based on their degree of radiosensitivity or radioresistance. In this work, a CNN architecture is built for identifying post-irradiation spectral changes in Raman spectra of tumour tissue. The model was trained to classify irradiated versus non-irradiated tissue using Raman spectra of breast tumour xenografts. The CNN effectively classified the tissue spectra, with accuracies exceeding 92.1% for data collected 3\u00a0days post-irradiation, and 85.0% at day 1 post-irradiation. Furthermore, the CNN was evaluated using a leave-one-out- (mouse, section or Raman map) validation approach to investigate its generalization to new test subjects. The CNN retained good predictive accuracy (average accuracies 83.7%, 91.4%, and 92.7%, respectively) when little to no information for a specific subject was given during training. Finally, the classification performance of the CNN was compared to that of a previously developed model based on group and basis restricted non-negative matrix factorization and random forest (GBR-NMF-RF) classification. We found that CNN yielded higher classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in mice assessed 3\u00a0days post-irradiation, as compared with the GBR-NMF-RF approach. Overall, the CNN can detect biochemical spectral changes in tumour tissue at an early time point following irradiation, without the need for previous manual feature extraction.

{"title": "Deep learning radiomic analysis of DCE-MRI combined with clinical characteristics predicts pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning-based radiomic (DLR) model combined with clinical characteristics for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. For early prediction of pCR, the DLR model was based on pre-treatment and early treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data.\nThis retrospective study included 95 women (mean age, 48.1 years; range, 29-77 years) who underwent DCE-MRI before (pre-treatment) and after two or three cycles of NAC (early treatment) from 2018 to 2021. The patients in this study were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=67) and a validation cohort (n=28) at a ratio of 7:3. Deep learning and handcrafted features were extracted from pre- and early treatment DCE-MRI contoured lesions. These features contribute to the construction of radiomic signature RS1 and RS2 representing information from different periods. Mutual information and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for feature selection. A combined model was then developed based on the DCE-MRI features and clinical characteristics. The performance of the models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong test.\nThe overall pCR rate was 25.3% (24/95). One radiomic feature and three deep learning features in RS1, five radiomic features and 11 deep learning features in RS2, and five clinical characteristics remained in the feature selection. The performance of the DLR model combining pre- and early treatment information (AUC=0.900) was better than that of RS1 (AUC=0.644, P=0.068) and slightly higher that of RS2 (AUC=0.888, P=0.604) in the validation cohort. The combined model including pre- and early treatment information and clinical characteristics showed the best ability with an AUC of 0.925 in the validation cohort.\nThe combined model integrating pre-treatment, early treatment DCE-MRI data, and clinical characteristics showed good performance in predicting pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. Early treatment DCE-MRI and clinical characteristics may play an important role in evaluating the outcomes of NAC by predicting pCR.", "journal": "Frontiers in oncology", "date": "2023-01-24", "authors": ["YutingLi", "YahengFan", "DinghuaXu", "YanLi", "ZhangnanZhong", "HaoyuPan", "BingshengHuang", "XiaotongXie", "YangYang", "BihuaLiu"], "doi": "10.3389/fonc.2022.1041142\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.3760/cma.j.cn112149-20210912-00846\n10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62422-8\n10.1148/radiol.2019182947\n10.1007/s00330-015-3948-0\n10.3348/kjr.2018.19.4.682\n10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.036\n10.1007/s00330-020-07414-3\n10.1007/s00330-020-07423-2\n10.1007/s00330-020-06968-6\n10.1186/s13058-017-0846-1\n10.1109/jbhi.2020.3043236\n10.3389/fonc.2022.897676\n10.1002/ijc.34053\n10.3389/fonc.2022.846775\n10.5858/134.7.e48\n10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871994\n10.1093/annonc/mdt303\n10.1016/s0960-9776(03)00106-1\n10.1609/aaai.v36i3.20144\n10.1109/iccv.2017.74\n10.1007/s10549-017-4155-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0236182\n10.1158/1078-0432.Ccr-18-3190\n10.1148/radiol.2019182718\n10.3389/fmolb.2021.622219\n10.1038/s41467-020-15027-z\n10.1007/s00330-022-08857-6\n10.1016/j.ejca.2021.01.028\n10.1007/s00330-021-08293-y\n10.1038/nrc3261\n10.1109/jbhi.2021.3070708\n10.1016/j.media.2018.07.010\n10.1016/j.inffus.2017.10.005\n10.4174/astr.2019.96.4.169\n10.1007/s10549-018-4981-x\n10.1159/000508478\n10.1245/s10434-021-10195-8\n10.1007/s00330-021-08414-7"}

The great efforts made to set screening campaigns, early detection programs, and increasingly targeted treatments led to significant improvement in patients' survival. The Full-Field Digital Mammograph (FFDM) is considered the gold standard method for the early diagnosis of BC. From several previous studies, it has emerged that breast density (BD) is a risk factor in the development of BC, affecting the periodicity of screening plans present today at an international level.\nin this study, the focus is the development of mammographic image processing techniques that allow the extraction of indicators derived from textural patterns of the mammary parenchyma indicative of BD risk factors.\na total of 168 patients were enrolled in the internal training and test set while a total of 51 patients were enrolled to compose the external validation cohort. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been employed to classify breasts based on the values of the tissue density. Textural features were extracted only from breast parenchyma with which to train classifiers, thanks to the aid of ML algorithms.\nthe accuracy of different tested classifiers varied between 74.15% and 93.55%.

{"title": "Artificial intelligence in breast cancer imaging: risk stratification, lesion detection and classification, treatment planning and prognosis-a narrative review.", "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) represents a real game changer in today's landscape of breast cancer imaging. Several innovative AI-based tools have been developed and validated in recent years that promise to accelerate the goal of real patient-tailored management. Numerous studies confirm that proper integration of AI into existing clinical workflows could bring significant benefits to women, radiologists, and healthcare systems. The AI-based approach has proved particularly useful for developing new risk prediction models that integrate multi-data streams for planning individualized screening protocols. Furthermore, AI models could help radiologists in the pre-screening and lesion detection phase, increasing diagnostic accuracy, while reducing workload and complications related to overdiagnosis. Radiomics and radiogenomics approaches could extrapolate the so-called imaging signature of the tumor to plan a targeted treatment. The main challenges to the development of AI tools are the huge amounts of high-quality data required to train and validate these models and the need for a multidisciplinary team with solid machine-learning skills. The purpose of this article is to present a summary of the most important AI applications in breast cancer imaging, analyzing possible challenges and new perspectives related to the widespread adoption of these new tools.", "journal": "Exploration of targeted anti-tumor therapy", "date": "2023-01-20", "authors": ["MaurizioC\u00e8", "ElenaCaloro", "Maria EPellegrino", "MariachiaraBasile", "AdrianaSorce", "DeborahFazzini", "GiancarloOliva", "MichaelaCellina"], "doi": "10.37349/etat.2022.00113\n10.1007/s12013-014-0459-6\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66546-4\n10.3390/cancers13174287\n10.1038/s41568-018-0016-5\n10.1186/s43055-020-00175-5\n10.1155/2018/6120703\n10.1148/radiol.2019182716\n10.1038/s41523-018-0079-1\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105221\n10.1007/s00330-021-08306-w\n10.21037/cco-20-15\n10.1186/s41747-018-0061-6\n10.1016/j.breast.2017.09.003\n10.1016/j.breast.2019.12.014\n10.1017/CBO9781107298019\n10.1016/B978-0-12-823504-1.00011-8\n10.1038/nature14539\n10.14245/ns.1938396.198.c1\n10.3390/cancers14051349\n10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.036\n10.3390/diagnostics11101796\n10.1186/s13244-019-0795-6\n10.1007/s11547-020-01318-4\n10.5152/dir.2019.19321\n10.2967/jnumed.118.222893\n10.1016/j.jacr.2015.04.019\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.11.002\n10.7314/APJCP.2016.17.S3.43\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.2445\n10.1089/pop.2015.29023.mor\n10.1001/jama.2014.6095\n10.7326/M19-2125\n10.1259/bjr.20190610\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.5231\n10.1053/j.ro.2021.12.005\n10.1097/GRF.0000000000000239\n10.7150/ijbs.21635\n10.1016/j.crad.2017.11.018\n10.14694/EdBook_AM.2013.33.e57\n10.6004/jnccn.2010.0085\n10.1016/j.acra.2006.06.005\n10.7326/M15-2934\n10.1016/j.breast.2016.06.020\n10.3390/diagnostics7020030\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.6326\n10.1038/s41598-021-99433-3\n10.1118/1.4736530\n10.1016/j.breast.2012.01.005\n10.48550/arXiv.1610.01644\n10.4103/0971-3026.169458\n10.1259/bjr.20151057\n10.1016/j.media.2021.102138\n10.1186/s13058-016-0755-8\n10.1002/mp.13886\n10.1093/jnci/djm223\n10.1002/sim.1913\n10.7326/0003-4819-148-5-200803040-00004\n10.1038/s41523-017-0035-5\n10.1245/s10434-019-07814-w\n10.1007/s00330-019-06186-9\n10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30185-0\n10.1117/12.2564179\n10.1016/j.crad.2019.02.006\n10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30003-0\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.0265\n10.1007/s00330-021-07686-3\n10.1148/radiol.212381\n10.1186/s13244-022-01183-x\n10.1016/j.media.2021.102049\n10.1148/radiol.2019182627\n10.1007/s00330-021-07992-w\n10.1148/ryai.2019180096\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.19100\n10.1148/radiol.2020200292\n10.1038/nature11412\n10.1093/jbi/wbaa110\n10.1684/abc.2016.1192\n10.1007/s11547-021-01389-x\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141\n10.1007/s11547-021-01423-y\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.04.019\n10.1259/bjr.20151030\n10.1016/j.crad.2016.09.013\n10.1038/ncomms5644\n10.1007/s11547-022-01512-6\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2021.109624\n10.1148/radiol.15142698\n10.1038/srep17787\n10.3390/cancers12102881\n10.1038/s41523-017-0045-3\n10.1016/j.acra.2018.04.019\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-1170\n10.3390/jcm9061853\n10.1038/npjbcancer.2016.12\n10.1186/s40644-019-0233-5\n10.31661/jbpe.v0i0.958\n10.1007/s00414-019-02139-5\n10.1002/mp.12254\n10.1002/jmri.26860\n10.1088/1361-6560/ab7e7f\n10.1016/j.mri.2021.06.017\n10.1002/jmri.26762\n10.1002/jmri.26636\n10.1002/mp.14581\n10.1007/s10278-018-0114-7\n10.21037/qims.2020.01.12\n10.1186/s13014-021-01771-z\n10.1186/s13014-021-01923-1\n10.1007/s11547-021-01436-7\n10.1007/s12094-009-0418-7\n10.1634/theoncologist.9-6-606\n10.1002/jmri.26852\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2021.109882\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000518\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3190\n10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.103042\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.2561\n10.1007/s10549-018-4990-9\n10.1186/s13058-020-01291-w\n10.3389/fonc.2021.621993\n10.1259/bjr.20210188\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3783\n10.2147/CMAR.S271876\n10.1148/radiol.14131375\n10.1038/srep21394\n10.1002/jmri.26244\n10.4048/jbc.2012.15.2.230\n10.1007/s00330-017-5005-7\n10.1007/s00330-018-5981-2\n10.3109/02841851.2010.498444\n10.1007/s12032-020-01368-8\n10.1016/j.crad.2019.04.002\n10.1148/radiol.2020191145\n10.1016/j.inffus.2022.01.001"}

Data types used included tumor ADC values, diffusion-weighted and dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI at three treatment timepoints, and patient demographics and tumor data. GLCM textural analysis was performed on MRI data. An extreme gradient boosting machine learning algorithm was used to predict pCR. Prediction performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve along with precision and recall.\nPrediction using texture features of DWI and DCE images at multiple treatment time points (AUC = 0.871; 95% CI: (0.768, 0.974; p<0.001) and (AUC = 0.903 95% CI: 0.854, 0.952; p<0.001) respectively), outperformed that using mean tumor ADC (AUC = 0.850 (95% CI: 0.764, 0.936; p<0.001)). The AUC using all MRI data was 0.933 (95% CI: 0.836, 1.03; p<0.001). The AUC using non-MRI data was 0.919 (95% CI: 0.848, 0.99; p<0.001).

Preoperative axial dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 352 lesions were used to train, validate, and test three different types of deep learning models.

{"title": "Prognostic value of desmoplastic stromal reaction, tumor budding and tumor-stroma ratio in stage II colorectal cancer.", "abstract": "Existing high-risk factors are insufficient to accurately predict the postoperative recurrence risk of stage II colorectal cancer (CRC). The discovery of additional prognostic markers may be the key to improving the current status of stage II CRC treatment. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship among desmoplastic reaction (DR), tumor budding (TBd), the tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) and their prognostic value for relapse-free survival (RFS).\nIn this study, 207 patients with histologically confirmed stage II CRC from January 2012 to August 2018 were retrospectively reviewed from a single center; the cohort was divided into subgroups based on low or high TSR, and low, intermediate or high DR and TBd. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and log-rank test were applied to examine RFS among subgroups. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to identify independent factors associated with RFS, and a nomogram was subsequently developed.\nAbnormal CA242, CEA, T4 stage, presence of hypertension, internal obstruction or perforation (IOP), lymphovascular or/and perineural invasion (PNI), number of nodes examined less than 12, low-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-L), higher Ki-67 and immature DR were associated with a lower RFS. In multivariable analysis, DR (HR =2.111; 95% CI: 1.184-3.766; P=0.011), LVI (HR =1.919; 95% CI: 1.004-3.669; P=0.049) and PNI (HR =2.724; 95% CI: 1.362-5.448; P=0.005) were prognostic factors for RFS. On this basis, a nomogram that integrated DR and clinicopathologic predictors for predicting RFS passed the calibration and had an area under the curve of 0.826.\nThe prognostic significance of DR outperformed TBd and TSR, therefore, we recommend adding DR as a biomarker in routine pathological reports. The novel nomogram combining these factors may be used as a reliable and effective tool for the prediction of RFS in stage II CRC, thus helping optimize therapeutic regimens under cooperation of oncologists and surgeons. Further multicentric studies are required for validation of this novel, simple and cost-effective prognostic model.", "journal": "Journal of gastrointestinal oncology", "date": "2023-01-14", "authors": ["ShuxuanFan", "XiaonanCui", "LeiZheng", "WenjuanMa", "SunyiZheng", "JingWang", "LishaQi", "ZhaoxiangYe"], "doi": "10.21037/jgo-22-758\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.1097/CM9.0000000000001474\n10.1200/JCO.2002.11.084\n10.1200/JCO.2010.34.3426\n10.1097/MPA.0000000000001504\n10.3390/cancers13050987\n10.1093/annonc/mds246\n10.1093/annonc/mdt593\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1686\n10.1080/0284186X.2017.1385841\n10.1111/his.13489\n10.1159/000218708\n10.3390/ijms140713129\n10.1097/PAS.0000000000001304\n10.1038/s41379-018-0028-4\n10.1038/modpathol.2017.46\n10.1136/jclinpath-2021-207957\n10.1007/s00384-018-3076-9\n10.1177/15330338211045826\n10.1136/gut.2003.028365\n10.1245/s10434-014-4149-9\n10.1097/PAS.0b013e318235edee\n10.1002/1097-0142(1950)3:1<32::AID-CNCR2820030106>3.0.CO;2-3\n10.1097/PAS.0000000000001272\n10.1200/JCO.2012.42.5645\n10.1200/JCO.2016.68.4886\n10.1200/JCO.2015.65.3048\n10.1245/s10434-019-07931-6\n10.1038/s41416-019-0671-7\n10.1016/j.humpath.2018.05.010\n10.1097/PAS.0000000000000504\n10.1097/PAS.0b013e318184cd55\n10.1097/PAS.0000000000000931\n10.1186/s12957-015-0674-7\n10.1002/cjp2.73\n10.1016/j.surg.2017.09.007\n10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70491-1\n10.2147/CMAR.S212094\n10.3389/fonc.2021.644933\n10.1016/S1470-2045(14)71116-7"}

However, US remains an operator-dependent examination. Research into and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast US are increasing. The aim of this rapid review was to assess the current development of US-based artificial intelligence in the field of breast cancer.\nTwo investigators with experience in medical research performed literature searching and data extraction on PubMed. The studies included in this rapid review evaluated the role of artificial intelligence concerning BC diagnosis, prognosis, molecular subtypes of breast cancer, axillary lymph node status, and the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The mean values of sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were calculated for the main study categories with a meta-analytical approach.\nA total of 58 main studies, all published after 2017, were included. Only 9/58 studies were prospective (15.5%); 13/58 studies (22.4%) used an ML approach. The vast majority (77.6%) used DL systems.

In the I-SPY-1 TRIAL, 155 patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer with breast tumors underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The inputs were dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, and T2- weighted MRI as three-dimensional whole-images without the tumor segmentation, as well as molecular subtypes and demographics. The outcomes were PCR, RCB, and PFS. Three (\"Integrated\", \"Stack\" and \"Concatenation\") CNN were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristics and mean absolute errors. The Integrated approach outperformed the \"Stack\" or \"Concatenation\" CNN. Inclusion of both MRI and non-MRI data outperformed either alone. The combined pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy data outperformed either alone. Using the best model and data combination, PCR prediction yielded an accuracy of 0.81\u00b10.03 and AUC of 0.83\u00b10.03; RCB prediction yielded an accuracy of 0.80\u00b10.02 and Cohen's \u03ba of 0.73\u00b10.03; PFS prediction yielded a mean absolute error of 24.6\u00b10.7 months (survival ranged from 6.6 to 127.5 months).

Recent trials have shown that 5-fraction ultrahypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (U-WBI) has similar outcomes to longer courses, reducing the cost and inconvenience of treatment. We performed a cost-utility analysis to compare U-WBI to hormone therapy alone or their combination.\nWe simulated 3 different treatment approaches for women age 65 years or older with pT1-2N0 ER-positive invasive ductal carcinoma treated with lumpectomy with negative margins using a Markov microsimulation model. The strategies were U-WBI performed with a 3-dimensional conformal technique over 5 fractions without a boost (\"radiation therapy [RT] alone\"), adjuvant hormone therapy (anastrozole for 5 years) without RT (\"aromatase-inhibitor [AI] alone\"), or the combination of the 2. The combination strategy was calibrated to match trial results, and the relative effectiveness of the RT alone and AI alone strategies were inferred from previous randomized trials. The primary endpoint was the cost-effectiveness of the 3 strategies over a lifetime horizon as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with a value of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year deemed \"cost-effective.\"\nThe model results compared with the prespecified target outcomes. On average, RT alone was the least expensive strategy ($14,775), with AI alone slightly more ($14,998), and combination therapy the costliest ($19,802). RT alone dominated AI alone (the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] -$5089). Combination therapy, compared with RT alone, was slightly more expensive than our definition of cost-effective (ICER $113,468) but was cost-effective compared with AI alone (ICER $54,451). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated RT alone to be cost-effective in 50% of trials, with combination therapy in 36% and AI alone in 14%.\nU-WBI alone appears the more cost-effective de-escalation strategy for these low-risk patients, compared with AI alone.

{"title": "New Explainable Deep CNN Design for Classifying Breast Tumor Response Over Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.", "abstract": "To reduce breast tumor size before surgery, Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) is applied systematically to patients with local breast cancer. However, with the existing clinical protocols, it is not yet possible to have an early prediction of the effect of chemotherapy on a breast tumor. Predicting the response to chemotherapy could reduce toxicity and delay effective treatment. Computational analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Images (DCE-MRI) through Deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has proved a significant performance in classifying responders and no responder's patients. This study intends to present a new explainable Deep Learning (DL) model predicting the breast cancer response to chemotherapy based on multiple MRI inputs.\nIn this study, a cohort of 42 breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy was used to train and validate the proposed DL model. This dataset was provided by the Jules Bordet institute of radiology in Brussels, Belgium. 14 external subjects were used to validate the DL model to classify responding or non-responding patients on temporal DCE-MRI volumes. The model performance was assessed by the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), accuracy, and features map visualization according to pathological complete response (Ground truth).\nThe developed deep learning architecture was able to predict the responding breast tumors to chemotherapy treatment in the external validation dataset with an AUC of 0.93 using parallel learning MRI images acquired at different moments. The visual results showed that the most important extracted features from non-responding tumors are in the peripheral and external tumor regions. The model proposed in this study is more efficient compared to those proposed in the literature.\nEven with a limited training dataset size, the developed multi-input CNN model using DCE-MR images acquired before and following the first chemotherapy was able to predict responding and non-responding tumors with higher accuracy. Thanks to the visualization of the extracted characteristics by the DL model on the responding and non-responding tumors, the latter could be used henceforth in clinical analysis after its evaluation based on more extra data.", "journal": "Current medical imaging", "date": "2022-12-20", "authors": ["Mohammed ElAdoui", "StylianosDrisis", "MohammedBenjelloun"], "doi": "10.2174/1573405618666220803124426"}
{"title": "Mapping age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence in adults in sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2018.", "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 years across SSA.\nWe analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5\u2009\u00d7\u20095-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units.\nWe found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group.\nAs the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.", "journal": "BMC medicine", "date": "2022-12-19", "authors":

We also performed subgroup analyses to identify the appropriate patient for SLNB.\nA total of 220 patients with cytologically proven axillary node-positive breast cancer who underwent both SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after NAT were included. We calculated the FNR of SLNB. In the case of post-NAT AUS results available, AUS was classified as negative or positive. Then the FNR of post-NAT AUS combined with SLNB was evaluated. Subgroup analyses based on the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed, molecular subtypes, and the clinical N stage were also performed.\nThe overall axillary lymph node pathological complete response rate was 45.5% (100/220). The FNR of SLNB alone was 15.8% (95%CI: 9.2 to 22.5%). Post-NAT AUS results were available for 181 patients. When combined negative post-NAT AUS results and SLNB, the FNR was reduced to 7.5% (95%CI: 2.4 to 12.7%). Subgroup analyses of the FNR for SLNB alone and negative post-NAT AUS combined with SLNB were shown as follows: in cases patients with less than three sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and at least three SLNs removed, the FNR was decreased from 24.5 to 13.2%, and 9.0 to 5.0%, respectively.

For cN1 patients, the FNR was decreased from 18.1 to 12.1% while 17.1 to 3.6% for cN2 patients and 0% for cN3 patients.\nUsing negative post-NAT AUS may help to decrease the FNR and improve patient selection for SLNB.", "journal": "Breast cancer research and treatment", "date": "2022-12-14", "authors": ["YuLiu", "YingWang", "SenwenFeng", "ZeyanXu", "MengxiaYao", "XiaomeiHuang", "PinxiongLi", "LeiWu", "ChunlingLiu", "XinChen", "ChanghongLiang", "ZaiyiLiu"], "doi": "10.1007/s10549-022-06817-8\n10.1001/jamasurg.2021.0891\n10.1200/JCO.2006.07.4062\n10.1200/JCO.2005.05.188\n10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70166-9\n10.1001/jama.2013.278932\n10.1200/JCO.2014.55.7827\n10.1200/JCO.2015.64.0094\n10.1200/JCO.2014.60.1112\n10.1200/JCO.2016.71.0947\n10.1007/s10549-020-05559-9\n10.1148/radiol.2019190014\n10.1007/s00330-019-06539-4\n10.1148/rg.2021210053\n10.1016/j.breast.2016.11.012\n10.1016/j.breast.2017.05.015\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000004356\n10.1200/JCO.2014.57.8401\n10.1245/s10434-019-07809-7\n10.1016/j.breast.2021.07.015\n10.1245/s10434-021-10195-8\n10.1245/s10434-007-9759-z\n10.6004/jnccn.2021.0023\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000003126\n10.1093/jnci/djaa201\n10.1200/JCO.2009.25.6529\n10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32417-5\n10.1245/s10434-020-08900-0\n10.1016/j.ejso.2020.10.014\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.4394\n10.1245/s10434-020-09211-0\n10.3390/cancers14030521\n10.1148/radiol.2020191639\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000001375\n10.3390/cancers13164167"}
{"title": "Staging Breast Cancer with MRI, the T. A Key Role in the Neoadjuvant Setting.", "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) indications have expanded from inoperable locally advanced to early-stage breast cancer. Achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) has been proven to be an excellent prognostic marker leading to better disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Although diagnostic accuracy of MRI has been shown repeatedly to be superior to conventional methods in assessing the extent of breast disease there are still controversies regarding the indication of MRI in this setting. We intended to review the complex literature concerning the tumor size in staging, response and surgical planning in patients with early breast cancer receiving NACT, in order to clarify the role of MRI.

The rate is rising at 0.4% per year. Early detection is crucial to improve treatment efficacy and overall survival of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Digital Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis have widely demonstrated their role as a screening tool. However, screening mammography is limited by radiologist's experience, unnecessarily high recalls, overdiagnosis, overtreatment and, in the case of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, long reporting time. This is compounded by an increasing shortage of manpower and resources issue, especially among breast imaging specialists. Recent advances in image analysis with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast imaging have the potential to overcome some of these needs and address the clinical challenges in cancer detection, assessment of treatment response, and monitoring disease progression. This article focuses on the most important clinical implication and future application of AI in the field of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, providing the readers with a comprehensive overview of AI impact in cancer detection, diagnosis, reduction of workload and breast cancer risk stratification.", "journal": "Current medical imaging", "date": "2022-11-30", "authors": ["DalyAvenda\u00f1o", "CarmeloSofia", "PedroZapata", "AntonioPortaluri", "Alessia AngelaMaria Orlando", "PabloAvalos", "AlfredoBlandino", "GiorgioAscenti", "ServandoCardona-Huerta", "Maria AdeleMarino"], "doi": "10.2174/1573405619666221128102209"}
{"title": "Intrinsic subtypes and therapeutic decision-making in hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with visceral crisis: A case report.", "abstract": "CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDKi), namely, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, combined with either an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or fulvestrant are the standard first/second line for hormone receptor-positive(HR+)/HER2-negative(neg) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, the choice of one specific CDKi is arbitrary and based on the physician's experience with the drug, toxicity profile, and patient's preferences, whereas biomarkers for optimal patient selection have not been established so far. Moreover, upfront chemotherapy is still recommended in case of clinical presentation with visceral crisis, despite no evidence of superior benefit for chemotherapy regimens against CDKi-based regimens. Recent correlative biomarker analyses from pivotal trials of palbociclib and ribociclib showed that HR+/HER2-neg MBC might respond differently according to the molecular intrinsic subtype, with Luminal A and B tumors being sensitive to both CDKi, Basal-like being insensitive to endocrine therapy, irrespective of CDKi, and HER2-enriched tumors showing a benefit only with ribociclib-based therapy.\nWe hereby present a paradigmatic clinical case of a woman affected by a relapsed HR+/HER2-neg MBC with bone and nodal lesions, presenting with a visceral crisis in the form of lymphangitis carcinomatosis and diagnosed with a molecularly HER2-enriched tumor, successfully treated with upfront ribociclib + fulvestrant. The patient experienced a complete symptomatic and radiologic remission of the lymphangitis with a partial response as best response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. The progression-free survival (PFS) was of 20 months, in line with the median PFS observed in the ribociclib + fulvestrant pivotal trial, where, however, patients with visceral crisis had been excluded.\nThis clinical case confirms in the real-world setting that non-luminal subtypes can be found in HR+/HER2-neg disease and may have potential therapeutic implications in the metastatic setting. It also questions the recommendation of upfront chemotherapy in the case of a visceral crisis in the era of CDKi-based regimens.

Accurate prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC in the early-stage or posttreatment can optimize treatment strategies or improve the breast-conserving rate. This study aimed to develop and validate an autosegmentation-based serial ultrasonography assessment system (SUAS) that incorporated serial ultrasonographic features throughout the NAC of breast cancer to predict pCR.\nA total of 801 patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer were retrospectively enrolled from three institutions and were split into a training cohort (242 patients), an internal validation cohort (197 patients), and two external test cohorts (212 and 150 patients). Three imaging signatures were constructed from the serial ultrasonographic features before (pretreatment signature), during the first-second cycle of (early-stage treatment signature), and after (posttreatment signature) NAC based on autosegmentation by U-net. The SUAS was constructed by subsequently integrating the pre, early-stage, and posttreatment signatures, and the incremental performance was analysed.\nThe SUAS yielded a favourable performance in predicting pCR, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.927 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.891-0.963] and 0.914 (95% CI 0.853-0.976), compared with those of the clinicopathological prediction model [0.734 (95% CI 0.665-0.804) and 0.610 (95% CI 0.504-0.716)], and radiologist interpretation [0.632 (95% CI 0.570-0.693) and 0.724 (95% CI 0.644-0.804)] in the external test cohorts.

The ability to predict which patient will respond to NAC early in the treatment course is important because it could help to minimize unnecessary toxic NAC and to modify regimens mid-treatment to achieve better efficacy. Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in radiology and medicine because it can identify relationships amongst complex data elements to inform outcomes without the need to specify such relationships a priori. One of the most popular deep learning methods that applies to medical images is the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In contrast to supervised ML, deep learning CNN can operate on the whole images without requiring radiologists to manually contour the tumor on images. Although there have been many review papers on supervised ML prediction of pCR, review papers on deep learning prediction of pCR are sparse. Deep learning CNN could also incorporate multiple image types, clinical data such as demographics and molecular subtypes, as well as data from multiple treatment time points to predict pCR. The goal of this study is to perform a systematic review of deep learning methods that use whole-breast MRI images without annotation or tumor segmentation to predict pCR in breast cancer.", "journal": "Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)", "date": "2022-11-23", "authors": ["NabeehaKhan", "RichardAdam", "PaulineHuang", "TakouhieMaldjian", "Tim QDuong"], "doi": "10.3390/tomography8060232\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3492\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2022.110561\n10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62422-8\n10.1038/s41598-018-27764-9\n10.1002/cncr.27995\n10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.001593\n10.1590/0100-3984.2019.0049\n10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30333-X\n10.1038/s41571-020-0329-7\n10.1038/nature14539\n10.1007/s13244-018-0639-9\n10.4048/jbc.2012.15.2.203\n10.1016/j.breast.2019.11.009\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2022.110247\n10.1038/s41598-021-93592-z\n10.1007/s11548-020-02209-9\n10.1007/s10278-018-0144-1\n10.1038/s41598-021-98408-8\n10.1016/j.mri.2020.08.021\n10.3390/jpm12060953\n10.3389/fonc.2022.846775\n10.1111/1759-7714.13309\n10.1002/jmri.26762\n10.1245/s10434-018-6613-4\n10.1016/j.clbc.2019.11.009\n10.1016/j.clbc.2019.06.006\n10.1016/j.clbc.2021.07.002\n10.1007/s10278-018-0086-7\n10.1088/1361-6560/abcd17\n10.1186/s12938-021-00899-z"}

HR-QoL has been assessed in trials testing cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) in breast cancer (BC), using various questionnaires at different timepoints. HR-QoL reports from BC patients treated with CDK4/6i in the real-world setting are also available.\nWe systematically reviewed the literature, searching for full-length articles, and selected conference abstracts reporting data on HR-QoL in BC patients at any stage and of any molecular subtype treated with abemaciclib, palbociclib or ribociclib.\nA total of 533 full-length articles and 143 abstracts were retrieved. After screening for eligibility, 38 records were included (31 clinical trials; 7 real-world reports). Assessment methods were heterogeneous across studies in terms of questionnaires, evaluation timepoints and endpoints. Overall, adding CDK4/6i to endocrine therapy did not worsen patients' HR-QoL, with a positive trend towards pain improvement. Gastrointestinal scores (diarrhea, nausea and appetite loss) statistically favored the control arm among metastatic BC patients receiving abemaciclib, whereas they were superimposable in the early setting. The combination of palbociclib and endocrine therapy showed similar HR-QoL outcomes compared with endocrine therapy alone, but determined better scores compared with chemotherapy. HR-QoL was specifically assessed in premenopausal patients treated with ribociclib, showing similar scores compared with postmenopausal patients.\nDespite methodological heterogeneity does not allow a proper comparison, HR-QoL was generally maintained with CDK4/6i. However, differences between abemaciclib, palbociclib and ribociclib exist and mainly rely on the distinct safety profiles of the compounds. These differences should be acknowledged and taken into account in the clinical practice.", "journal": "ESMO open", "date": "2022-11-19", "authors": ["VDi Lauro", "GBarchiesi", "FMartorana", "GZucchini", "MMuratore", "CFontanella", "GArpino", "LDel Mastro", "MGiuliano", "FPuglisi", "MDe Laurentiis"], "doi": "10.1016/j.esmoop.2022.100629\n10.1111/ajco.13653"}

We evaluated whether use of intelligent multi-modal shear wave elastography (SWE) can reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies without impairing the breast cancer detection rate.\nWe trained, tested, and validated machine learning algorithms using SWE, clinical, and patient information to classify breast masses. We used data from 857 women who underwent B-mode breast ultrasound, SWE, and subsequent histopathologic evaluation at 12 study sites in seven countries from 2016 to 2019. Algorithms were trained and tested on data from 11 of the 12 sites and externally validated using the additional site's data. We compared findings to the histopathologic evaluation and compared the diagnostic performance between B-mode breast ultrasound, traditional SWE, and intelligent multi-modal SWE.\nIn the external validation set (n\u00a0=\u00a0285), intelligent multi-modal SWE showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 97.1-100%, 126 of 126), a specificity of 50.3% (95% CI, 42.3-58.3%, 80 of 159), and an area under the curve\u00a0of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96). Diagnostic performance was significantly higher compared to traditional SWE and B-mode breast ultrasound (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

To identify independent predictors for axillary pCR, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on pre- and post-NAC MRI and clinicopathologic features. Then, a simplified scoring system was constructed based on regression coefficients of predictors in the multivariable model, and its predictive performance was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curve. The added value of the scoring system for reducing false-negative rate (FNR) of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was also evaluated.\nThe simplified scoring system including seven predictors: progesterone receptor-negative (Three points), HER2-positive (Two points), post-NAC clinical T0-1 stage (Two points), pre-NAC higher ADC value of breast tumor (One point), absence of perinodal infiltration at pre-NAC (One point) and post-NAC MRI (Two points), and absence of enhancement in the tumor bed at post-NAC MRI (Two points), showed good calibration and discrimination, with AUCs of 0.835, 0.828 and 0.798 in the training, internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The axillary pCR rates were increased with the total points of the scoring system, and patients with a score of \u226511 points had a pCR rate of 86%-100%. In test cohorts for simulating clinical application, the diagnostic accuracy for axillary pCR was 80%-90% among four different radiologists. Compared to standalone SLNB, combining the scoring system with SLNB reduced the FNR from 14.5% to 4.8%.\nThe clinicopathologic-image scoring system with good predictive performance for axillary pCR in clinically node-positive breast cancer, may guide axillary management after NAC and improve patient selection for de-escalating axillary surgery to reduce morbidity.", "journal": "Academic radiology", "date": "2022-10-25", "authors": ["XiaomeiHuang", "ZhenweiShi", "JinhaiMai", "ChunlingLiu", "ChenLiu", "ShutingChen", "HongLu", "YanboLi", "BoHe", "JunLi", "HanxueCun", "ChuHan", "XinChen", "ChanghongLiang", "ZaiyiLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.acra.2022.09.022"}

According to the Food and Drug Administration's Mammography Quality Standards Act and Program statistics, approximately 39 million mammography procedures are performed in the United States each year. Therefore, breast cancer screening is among the most common radiological tasks. Interpretation of screening mammograms by a specialist radiologist includes primarily the review of breast positioning quality, which is a key factor affecting the sensitivity of mammography and thus the diagnostic performance. Each mammogram with inadequate positioning may lead to a missed cancer or, in case of false positive signal interpretation, to follow-up activities, increased emotional burden and potential over-therapy and must be repeated, requiring the return of the patient. In this study, we have developed deep convolutional neuronal networks to differentiate mammograms with inadequate breast positioning from the adequate ones. The aim of the proposed automated positioning quality evaluation is to assist radiology technologists in detecting poorly positioned mammograms during patient visits, improve mammography performance, and decrease the recall rate. The implemented models have achieved 96.5% accuracy in cranio-caudal view classification and 93.3% accuracy in mediolateral oblique view regarding breast positioning quality. In addition to these results, we developed a software module that allows the study to be applied in practice by presenting the implemented model predictions and informing the technologist about the missing quality criteria.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2022-10-15", "authors": ["MounaBrahim", "KaiWesterkamp", "LouisaHempel", "ReinerLehmann", "DirkHempel", "PatrickPhilipp"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers14194704\n10.1038/s41598-019-48995-4\n10.1002/cncr.10765\n10.2214/ajr.178.4.1780805\n10.1016/j.ejmp.2016.03.004\n10.3390/s21082852\n10.3390/jcm8030355\n10.3390/s22082988\n10.1155/2021/5528622\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.06.002\n10.1016/j.acra.2011.09.014\n10.1148/radiology.188.3.8351351\n10.1148/radiology.215.3.r00jn32698\n10.1055/s-0028-1111066\n10.1155/2019/7351350\n10.1109/RBME.2012.2232289\n10.1118/1.2436974\n10.1016/j.acra.2011.10.026\n10.1102/1470-7330.2005.0018\n10.1177/1548512920973268\n10.1186/s40537-021-00444-8\n10.1016/j.matpr.2020.11.551\n10.1186/s40537-019-0276-2"}

Radiomics features were extracted from lymph node images instead of tumor region, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic algorithm was used to select the extracted features and generate radiomics score. Then, the important clinical factors and radiomics score were integrated into a nomogram. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the nomogram, and the clinical benefit of using the nomogram was evaluated by decision curve analysis. We found that clinical N stage and radiomics score were independent clinical predictors. Besides, the nomogram accurately predicted axillary lymph node metastasis, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.93-0.98) in the validation set, indicating satisfactory calibration. Decision curve analysis confirmed that the nomogram had higher clinical utility than clinical N stage or radiomics score alone. Overall, the nomogram based on radiomics features and clinical factors can help radiologists to predict axillary lymph node metastasis preoperatively and provide valuable information for individual treatment.", "journal": "Biomolecules & biomedicine", "date": "2022-10-14", "authors": ["JieqiuZhang", "GaofeiCao", "HaowenPang", "JinLi", "XiaopengYao"], "doi": "10.17305/bjbms.2022.7853"}
{"title": "Deep learning radiomics under multimodality explore association between muscle/fat and metastasis and survival in breast cancer patients.", "abstract": "Sarcopenia is correlated with poor clinical outcomes in breast cancer (BC) patients. However, there is no precise quantitative study on the correlation between body composition changes and BC metastasis and survival. The present study proposed a deep learning radiomics (DLR) approach to investigate the effects of muscle and fat on distant metastasis and death outcomes in BC patients. Image feature extraction was performed on 4th thoracic vertebra (T4) and 11th thoracic vertebra (T11) on computed tomography (CT) image levels by DLR, and image features were combined with clinical information to predict distant metastasis in BC patients. Clinical information combined with DLR significantly predicted distant metastasis in BC patients. In the test cohort, the area under the curve of model performance on clinical information combined with DLR was 0.960 (95% CI: 0.942-0.979, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The patients with distant metastases had a lower pectoral muscle index in T4 (PMI/T4) than in patients without metastases. PMI/T4 and visceral fat tissue area in T11 (VFA/T11) were independent prognostic factors for the overall survival in BC patients. The pectoralis muscle area in T4 (PMA/T4) and PMI/T4 is an independent prognostic factor for distant metastasis-free survival in BC patients. The current study further confirmed that muscle/fat of T4 and T11 levels have a significant effect on the distant metastasis of BC. Appending the network features of T4 and T11 to the model significantly enhances the prediction performance of distant metastasis of BC, providing a valuable biomarker for the early treatment of BC patients.", "journal": "Briefings in bioinformatics", "date": "2022-10-06", "authors": ["ShidiMiao", "HaoboJia", "KeCheng", "XiaohuiHu", "JingLi", "WenjuanHuang", "RuitaoWang"], "doi": "10.1093/bib/bbac432"}

{"title": "Identification of Anomalies in Mammograms through Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Diagnosis System.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the primary health issue that women may face at some point in their lifetime. This may lead to death in severe cases. A mammography procedure is used for finding suspicious masses in the breast. Teleradiology is employed for online treatment and diagnostics processes due to the unavailability and shortage of trained radiologists in backward and remote areas. The availability of online radiologists is uncertain due to inadequate network coverage in rural areas. In such circumstances, the Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) framework is useful for identifying breast abnormalities without expert radiologists. This research presents a decision-making system based on IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) to identify breast anomalies. The proposed technique encompasses the region growing algorithm to segment tumor that extracts suspicious part. Then, texture and shape-based features are employed to characterize breast lesions. The extracted features include first and second-order statistics, center-symmetric local binary pattern (CS-LBP), a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and shape-based techniques used to obtain various features from the mammograms. Finally, a fusion of machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA are employed to classify breast cancer using composite feature vectors. The experimental results exhibit the proposed framework's efficacy that separates the cancerous lesions from the benign ones using 10-fold cross-validations. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity attained are 96.3%, 94.1%, and 98.2%, respectively, through shape-based features from the MIAS database.

In this cross-sectional study nested in a breast cancer cohort, we investigated the association between AI exposure and early markers for cardiovascular disease in BC survivors.\nThe study population consisted of 569 women, who were 5-7\u00a0years (n\u2009=\u2009277) or 10-12\u00a0years (n\u2009=\u2009292) after BC diagnosis. All participants underwent carotid ultrasound, skin autofluorescence measurement and laboratory evaluation. To quantify AI exposure, we obtained the AI ratio by dividing the duration of AI use by the total duration of endocrine therapy (ET). Patients were classified according to their AI ratio into low (no ET or AI ratio\u2009<\u20090.40), intermediate (0.40\u2009\u2264\u2009AI ratio\u2009\u2264\u20090.60) or high AI exposure (AI ratio\u2009>\u20090.60). The association between AI ratio and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the presence of dyslipidemia was assessed using linear and logistic regression.\nMedian age at study visit was 55.5\u00a0years (range 45.2-63.8). Forty percent (n\u2009=\u2009231) of the study population had used AIs, of whom the majority sequentially with tamoxifen; median duration of AI use was 3.0\u00a0years. Mean cIMT and mean AGEs did not differ across AI exposure groups in univariable and multivariable analysis. The occurrence of dyslipidemia did not vary across AI exposure groups. Intermediate AI exposure was associated with more frequent occurrence of the combined endpoint (elevated cIMT, elevated AGEs and/or dyslipidemia). This association, however, was not present in the group with highest AI exposure.\nAI exposure was not associated with cIMT, AGEs or the presence of dyslipidemia.

{"title": "Antidiabetics, Anthelmintics, Statins, and Beta-Blockers as Co-Adjuvant Drugs in Cancer Therapy.", "abstract": "Over the last years, repurposed agents have provided growing evidence of fast implementation in oncology treatment such as certain antimalarial, anthelmintic, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic agents. In this study, the four agents of choice were present in our patients' daily treatment for nonmalignant-associated pathology and have known, light toxicity profiles. It is quite common for a given patient's daily administration schedule to include two or three of these drugs for the duration of their treatment. We chose to review the latest literature concerning metformin, employed as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes; mebendazole, as an anthelmintic; atorvastatin, as a cholesterol-lowering drug; propranolol, used in cardiovascular diseases as a nonspecific inhibitor of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. At the same time, certain key action mechanisms make them feasible antitumor agents such as for mitochondrial ETC inhibition, activation of the enzyme adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, amelioration of endogenous hyperinsulinemia, inhibition of selective tyrosine kinases (i.e., VEGFR2, TNIK, and BRAF), and mevalonate pathway inhibition. Despite the abundance of results from in vitro and in vivo studies, the only solid data from randomized clinical trials confirm metformin-related oncological benefits for only a small subset of nondiabetic patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and early-stage colorectal cancer. At the same time, clinical studies confirm metformin-related detrimental/lack of an effect for lung, breast, prostate cancer, and glioblastoma. For atorvastatin we see a clinical oncological benefit in patients and head and neck cancer, with a trend towards radioprotection of critical structures, thus supporting the role of atorvastatin as a promising agent for concomitant association with radiotherapy.

Previously, systemic chemotherapy failed to demonstrate significant benefit in patients with brain metastases, but in recent decades, targeted therapies and more recently immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have yielded promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, there is significant interest in harnessing the immunomodulatory effects of radiotherapy (RT) to synergize with ICIs. Herein, we discuss studies evaluating the impact of RT dose and fractionation on the immune response, early studies supporting the synergistic interaction between RT and ICIs, and ongoing clinical trials assessing the benefit of combination therapy in patients with brain metastases.", "journal": "Biomedicines", "date": "2022-09-24", "authors": ["Jennifer KMatsui", "Haley KPerlow", "Rohit KRaj", "Ansel PNalin", "Eric JLehrer", "RupeshKotecha", "Daniel MTrifiletti", "ShearwoodMcClelland", "KariKendra", "NicoleWilliams", "Dwight HOwen", "Carolyn JPresley", "Evan MThomas", "Sasha JBeyer", "Dukagjin MBlakaj", "Manmeet SAhluwalia", "Raju RRaval", "Joshua DPalmer"], "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines10092211\n10.1007/s11060-004-8093-6\n10.1038/s41572-018-0055-y\n10.1002/cncr.10541\n10.1093/noajnl/vdaa041\n10.1002/14651858.CD003869.pub4\n10.1002/onco.13575\n10.1002/1097-0142(195407)7:43.0.CO;2-S\n10.1056/NEJM199002223220802\n10.1001/jama.280.17.1485\n10.3171/2014.4.JNS13789\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70263-3\n10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70061-0\n10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30441-2\n10.1200/jco.2015.33.18_suppl.lba4\n10.1200/JCO.2018.78.6186\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.01.039\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.11.031\n10.1200/JCO.19.02767\n10.1093/annonc/mdr003\n10.1023/A:1008338312647\n10.1007/s11060-013-1079-5\n10.1038/s41571-019-0320-3\n10.1007/s12254-021-00709-1\n10.1002/cam4.140\n10.3978/j.issn.2304-3865.2015.06.03\n10.1093/neuonc/nov023\n10.14694/EdBook_AM.2015.35.67\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2019.07.012\n10.1038/nrc3239\n10.1038/labinvest.2013.130\n10.1056/NEJMoa1200690\n10.1200/JCO.2014.58.3708\n10.1016/S1470-2045(15)70054-9\n10.1056/NEJMoa1606774\n10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32409-7\n10.1056/NEJMoa1801005\n10.1056/NEJMoa1507643\n10.1056/NEJMoa1910231\n10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30111-X\n10.1200/JCO.19.03136\n10.1056/NEJMoa1809064\n10.1016/j.jtho.2021.04.014\n10.1001/archneur.1977.00500210025002\n10.3390/ijms17091543\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1080\n10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70432-1\n10.1158/1538-7445.SABCS17-P1-17-03\n10.3390/cancers12092480\n10.1016/j.ccell.2015.01.001\n10.1056/NEJM200103153441101\n10.1016/j.breast.2018.03.006\n10.1186/s12885-018-3994-5\n10.1016/j.ctrc.2016.03.005\n10.1111/tbj.12906\n10.1007/s10585-015-9740-3\n10.1056/NEJMoa1914609\n10.1056/NEJMoa2028485\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32531-9\n10.1016/S1470-2045(19)30689-8\n10.1016/S1042-3680(18)30365-6\n10.1186/s12943-017-0645-4\n10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70431-X\n10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70090-6\n10.1200/JCO.2004.11.044\n10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30053-5\n10.1093/annonc/mdu577\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70334-1\n10.1056/NEJMoa1805453\n10.1200/JCO.2021.39.15_suppl.9508\n10.6004/jnccn.2018.0047\n10.1200/JCO.2014.60.0379\n10.1056/NEJMra1703481\n10.1186/s12916-015-0455-8\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.0393\n10.1111/apt.13281\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2016.08.020\n10.1186/s40425-017-0300-z\n10.1200/JCO.2016.68.2005\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.2453\n10.1093/jnci/63.5.1229\n10.1016/j.canlet.2015.03.024\n10.1093/jnci/djs629\n10.1155/2013/658126\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0069\n10.1007/s10911-010-9194-9\n10.1126/sciimmunol.aag1266\n10.1002/1097-0142(19910501)67:9<2269::AID-CNCR2820670910>3.0.CO;2-Z\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19960301)65:5<688::AID-IJC21>3.0.CO;2-2\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19971127)73:5<757::AID-IJC24>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00099-5\n10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00007-8\n10.3390/ijms20133212\n10.3389/fonc.2018.00503\n10.1016/j.bj.2017.06.003\n10.18632/oncotarget.19994\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1525\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0073\n10.4049/jimmunol.174.12.7516\n10.1182/blood-2009-02-206870\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.09.049\n10.4049/jimmunol.180.5.3132\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0265\n10.3389/fonc.2012.00153\n10.1080/09553008214550781\n10.1016/j.wneu.2019.04.032\n10.3171/jns.1994.80.6.1074\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0593\n10.1016/j.radonc.2018.08.025\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.12.025\n10.1056/NEJMoa1112824\n10.1259/0007-1285-26-305-234\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.09.012\n10.1007/s00262-002-0280-8\n10.1038/nm0697-625\n10.4049/jimmunol.166.9.5398\n10.1038/nm1096-1096\n10.1158/1078-0432.728.11.2\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0381\n10.1039/D0NH00446D\n10.1016/j.actbio.2021.02.019\n10.3390/nano11071661\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.11.041\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.02.175\n10.1007/s11060-022-04038-z\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.9553\n10.3171/2017.7.JNS171286\n10.1007/s11060-018-2795-7\n10.3171/2012.5.JNS111929\n10.1016/j.radonc.2017.08.009\n10.1186/s40425-017-0282-x\n10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.2013"}
{"title": "Increased Clinical Pain Locations and Pain Sensitivity in Women After Breast Cancer Surgery: Influence of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy.", "abstract": "Aromatase inhibitors (AIs), which potently inhibit estrogen biosynthesis, are a standard treatment for hormone sensitive early-stage breast cancer. AIs have been associated with substantial joint pain and muscle stiffness (aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal syndrome). However, the link between AIs and number of clinical pain locations and pain sensitivity are less well understood. The aim of this study was to compare longitudinal changes in clinical pain and quantitative pain sensitivity between women who did or did not receive AI therapy.\nWomen with early-stage breast cancer were prospectively enrolled and assessed for clinical pain in surgical and nonsurgical body areas using the Brief Pain Inventory and Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire, and for pain sensitivity using quantitative sensory testing preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively. Pain outcomes between participants who did and did not begin adjuvant AI therapy were compared using Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks and generalized estimating equation linear regression analyses.\nClinical pain and pain sensitivity were comparable between AI (n=49) and no-AI (n=106) groups preoperatively. After adjusting for body mass index, AI therapy was associated with a greater increase in the number of painful nonsurgical body sites (significant time by treatment interaction, P =0.024). Pain location was most frequent in knees (28%), lower back (26%), and ankles/feet (17%). Quantitative sensory testing revealed a significant decrease in pain sensitivity (increased pressure pain threshold) in the no-AI group over time, but not in the AI group.\nAI therapy was associated with increased diffuse joint-related pain and greater post-treatment pain sensitivity, potentially implicating central sensitization as a contributing pain mechanism of aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal syndrome worthy of future investigation.", "journal": "The Clinical journal of pain", "date": "2022-09-23", "authors": ["YehuiZhu", "Marco LLoggia", "Robert REdwards", "Kelsey MFlowers", "Dennis WMu\u00f1oz-Vergara", "Ann HPartridge", "Kristin LSchreiber"], "doi": "10.1097/AJP.0000000000001073"}

However, the roles of immune cell-specific lncRNAs in glioblastoma (GBM) remain largely unknown. In this study, a novel computational framework was constructed to screen the tumor-infiltrating immune cell-associated lncRNAs (TIIClnc) for developing TIIClnc signature by integratively analyzing the transcriptome data of purified immune cells, GBM cell lines and bulk GBM tissues using six machine learning algorithms. As a result, TIIClnc signature could distinguish survival outcomes of GBM patients across four independent datasets, including the Xiangya in-house dataset, and more importantly, showed superior performance than 95 previously established signatures in gliomas. TIIClnc signature was revealed to be an indicator of the infiltration level of immune cells and predicted the response outcomes of immunotherapy. The positive correlation between TIIClnc signature and CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1 was verified in the Xiangya in-house dataset. As a newly demonstrated predictive biomarker, the TIIClnc signature enabled a more precise selection of the GBM population who would benefit from immunotherapy and should be validated and applied in the near future.", "journal": "Briefings in bioinformatics", "date": "2022-09-23", "authors": ["HaoZhang", "NanZhang", "WantaoWu", "RanZhou", "ShuyuLi", "ZeyuWang", "ZiyuDai", "LiyangZhang", "ZaoquLiu", "JianZhang", "PengLuo", "ZhixiongLiu", "QuanCheng"], "doi": "10.1093/bib/bbac386"}

Use of solid fuels generates household air pollution, which was associated with more than 2 million deaths in 2019. Although local patterns in cooking vary systematically, subnational trends in use of solid fuels have yet to be comprehensively analysed. We estimated the prevalence of solid-fuel use with high spatial resolution to explore subnational inequalities, assess local progress, and assess the effects on health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) without universal access to clean fuels.\nWe did a geospatial modelling study to map the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking at a 5 km\u2008\u00d7\u20085 km resolution in 98 LMICs based on 2\u00b71 million household observations of the primary cooking fuel used from 663 population-based household surveys over the years 2000 to 2018. We use observed temporal patterns to forecast household air pollution in 2030 and to assess the probability of attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target indicator for clean cooking. We aligned our estimates of household air pollution to geospatial estimates of ambient air pollution to establish the risk transition occurring in LMICs. Finally, we quantified the effect of residual primary solid-fuel use for cooking on child health by doing a counterfactual risk assessment to estimate the proportion of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years that could be associated with household air pollution.\nAlthough primary reliance on solid-fuel use for cooking has declined globally, it remains widespread. 593 million people live in districts where the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking exceeds 95%. 66% of people in LMICs live in districts that are not on track to meet the SDG target for universal access to clean energy by 2030. Household air pollution continues to be a major contributor to particulate exposure in LMICs, and rising ambient air pollution is undermining potential gains from reductions in the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking in many countries. We estimated that, in 2018, 205\u2008000 (95% uncertainty interval 147\u2008000-257\u2008000) children younger than 5 years died from lower respiratory tract infections that could be attributed to household air pollution.\nEfforts to accelerate the adoption of clean cooking fuels need to be substantially increased and recalibrated to account for subnational inequalities, because there are substantial opportunities to improve air quality and avert child mortality associated with household air pollution.\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.", "journal": "The Lancet.

{"title": "Deep learning in breast imaging.", "abstract": "Millions of breast imaging exams are performed each year in an effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality of breast cancer. Breast imaging exams are performed for cancer screening, diagnostic work-up of suspicious findings, evaluating extent of disease in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients, and determining treatment response. Yet, the interpretation of breast imaging can be subjective, tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Retrospective and small reader studies suggest that deep learning (DL) has great potential to perform medical imaging tasks at or above human-level performance, and may be used to automate aspects of the breast cancer screening process, improve cancer detection rates, decrease unnecessary callbacks and biopsies, optimize patient risk assessment, and open up new possibilities for disease prognostication. Prospective trials are urgently needed to validate these proposed tools, paving the way for real-world clinical use. New regulatory frameworks must also be developed to address the unique ethical, medicolegal, and quality control issues that DL algorithms present.

{"title": "Breast cancer detection using deep learning: Datasets, methods, and challenges ahead.", "abstract": "Breast Cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of mortality among women. About 1 in 8 US women (about 13%) will develop invasive BC throughout their lifetime. Early detection of this life-threatening disease not only increases the survival rate but also reduces the treatment cost. Fortunately, advancements in radiographic imaging like \"Mammograms\", \"Computed Tomography (CT)\", \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\", \"3D Mammography\", and \"Histopathological Imaging (HI)\" have made it feasible to diagnose this life-taking disease at an early stage. However, the analysis of radiographic images and Histopathological images is done by experienced radiologists and pathologists, respectively. The process is not only costly but also error-prone. Over the last ten years, Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed the world in every way possible. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of ML has shown outstanding results in a variety of fields, particularly in the biomedical industry, because of its ability to handle large amounts of data. DL techniques automatically extract the features by analyzing the high dimensional and correlated data efficiently. The potential and ability of DL models have also been utilized and evaluated in the identification and prognosis of BC, utilizing radiographic and Histopathological images, and have performed admirably. However, AI has shown good claims in retrospective studies only. External validations are needed for translating these cutting-edge AI tools as a clinical decision maker. The main aim of this research work is to present the critical analysis of the research and findings already done to detect and classify BC using various imaging modalities including \"Mammography\", \"Histopathology\", \"Ultrasound\", \"PET/CT\", \"MRI\", and \"Thermography\". At first, a detailed review of the past research papers using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning for BC classification and detection is carried out. We also review the publicly available datasets for the above-mentioned imaging modalities to make future research more accessible. Finally, a critical discussion section has been included to elaborate open research difficulties and prospects for future study in this emerging area, demonstrating the limitations of Deep Learning approaches.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2022-09-15", "authors": ["Nusrat Mohi UdDin", "Rayees AhmadDar", "MuzafarRasool", "AssifAssad"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106073"}
{"title": "BRCA2 BRC missense variants disrupt RAD51-dependent DNA repair.", "abstract": "Pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene predispose to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and other cancers. BRCA2 maintains genome stability through homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication fork protection. Nonsense or frameshift mutations leading to truncation of the BRCA2 protein are typically considered pathogenic; however, missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions can be challenging to functionally interpret. The majority of missense mutations in BRCA2 have been classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) with unknown functional consequences. In this study, we identified three BRCA2 VUS located within the BRC repeat region to determine their impact on canonical HDR and fork protection functions. We provide evidence that S1221P and T1980I, which map to conserved residues in the BRC2 and BRC7 repeats, compromise the cellular response to chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation, and display deficits in fork protection. We further demonstrate biochemically that S1221P and T1980I disrupt RAD51 binding and diminish the ability of BRCA2 to stabilize RAD51-ssDNA complexes. The third variant, T1346I, located within the spacer region between BRC2 and BRC3 repeats, is fully functional. We conclude that T1346I is a benign allele, whereas S1221P and T1980I are hypomorphic disrupting the ability of BRCA2 to fully engage and stabilize RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. Our results underscore the importance of correctly classifying BRCA2 VUS as pathogenic variants can impact both future cancer risk and guide therapy selection during cancer treatment.", "journal": "eLife", "date": "2022-09-14", "authors": ["JuditJimenez-Sainz", "JoshuaMathew", "GemmaMoore", "SudiptaLahiri", "JenniferGarbarino", "Joseph PEder", "EliRothenberg", "Ryan BJensen"], "doi": "10.7554/eLife.79183\n10.1186/s13073-019-0691-1\n10.1016/bs.mie.2017.11.008\n10.1016/s0027-5107(00)00152-4\n10.1107/S0907444913007051\n10.1093/hmg/6.1.53\n10.1182/blood-2010-12-324541\n10.1093/hmg/dds222\n10.1038/s41525-020-00158-5\n10.1073/pnas.0402105101\n10.1186/gb-2006-7-10-r100\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.019\n10.1073/pnas.1106971108\n10.1016/j.biocel.2006.08.002\n10.1093/nar/gkw242\n10.1073/pnas.95.9.5287\n10.1093/nar/gkq1020\n10.1016/s1097-2765(01)00175-7\n10.1038/nature03404\n10.1038/nsmb1245\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1587\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2081\n10.1002/humu.22478\n10.1073/pnas.92.6.2298\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210968\n10.1016/0165-1110(83)90047-7\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6189\n10.1074/jbc.M112.375014\n10.1038/nature09399\n10.1007/978-1-4939-0992-6_17\n10.1038/nsmb.2666\n10.3390/genes12050780\n10.3389/fgene.2022.884210\n10.1016/s1097-2765(02)00632-9\n10.1007/978-1-0716-0644-5_8\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btm404\n10.1093/nar/gkab308\n10.1038/nsmb.1904\n10.1016/s1568-7864(03)00097-1\n10.1016/j.dnarep.2013.10.006\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1006208\n10.1128/MCB.25.8.3127-3139.2005\n10.1038/s41586-018-0261-5\n10.1073/pnas.94.13.6927\n10.1016/j.xpro.2022.101371\n10.1016/s1097-2765(01)00174-5\n10.1002/cncr.11019\n10.1038/nature16142\n10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80035-0\n10.1038/nature01230\n10.1093/nar/gkv993\n10.15252/embj.201593132\n10.1007/978-1-60327-355-8_3\n10.1002/em.21944\n10.1074/jbc.M601249200\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.03.041\n10.1038/nmeth.2089\n10.1038/35044000\n10.1038/386804a0\n10.1073/pnas.96.24.13920\n10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008667\n10.1016/bs.mie.2017.12.008\n10.1016/bs.mie.2017.11.011\n10.1016/j.jmb.2009.09.011\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7601739\n10.1016/s0092-8674(02)00615-3\n10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.009\n10.1093/nar/gky427\n10.1074/jbc.272.51.31941\n10.1126/science.297.5588.1837\n10.1006/bbrc.2000.2392\n10.1016/s1097-2765(03)00394-0\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.062\n10.1038/nature24060"}
{"title": "The three horizons model applied to medical science.", "abstract": "The three horizons model is a framework that helps manage an organization's innovation strategy. This model considers three aspects (horizons) that should be present in the institution and guide the development of new systems. Applied to medical science, the horizons are considered as paradigms that set the guidelines for clinical knowledge. New technologies can influence this model by causing disruptive changes. Horizon 1 (evidence-based medicine) reflects the current paradigm and emphasizes the aspect of continuous improvement needed to strengthen it, such as with the introduction of the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology. Evidence-based medicine has made it possible to stop performing harmful interventions like autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation in cancer treatment for women with early poor prognosis breast cancer or to discontinue the erroneous belief that children should not sleep on their backs to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. Horizon 2 (real-world evidence) refers to a new model in which innovation has generated new capabilities. This change makes it possible to correct weaknesses of the previous paradigm, as in the case of pragmatic clinical trials. Real-world evidence has been used to show that drugs such as tofacitinib are effective without using methotrexate as background or to demonstrate the efficacy of chemotherapy in older patients with stage II colon cancer. Horizon 3 (precision medicine) involves a disruptive innovation, leading to the abandonment of the traditional mechanistic model of medical science and is made possible by the appearance of major advances such as artificial intelligence.

{"title": "Breast Masses Detection and Segmentation in Full-Field Digital Mammograms using Unified Convolution Neural Network.", "abstract": "Breast Cancer has been the primary reason for mortality in women of age between twenties and sixties worldwide; moreover early detection and treatment provides patients to get absolute treatment and decrease the mortality rate. Furthermore, recent research indicates that most experienced physicians have plenty of limitations, hence the plethora of work has been carried out to develop an automated mechanism of segmentation and classification of affected area and type of cancer; however, it is still considered to be highly challenging due to the variability of tumor in shape, low signal to noise ratio, shape, size and location of tumor. Furthermore, mammographic mass segmentation and detection are performed as a separate task and a convolution neural network is a highly adopted architecture for the same. In this research, we have designed and developed unified CNN architecture to perform the segmentation and detection of a breast mass. The unified-CNN architecture comprises a novel module for convolution which is combined through additional offset. Further RRS aka Random Region Selection mechanism is applied for data augmentation approach and high-level feature map is implied to achieve the high prediction. Furthermore, unified-CNN is evaluated using the metrics like true positive Rate at FPI (False Positive per Image) and Dice Index on INBreast dataset, also comparative analysis is out carried with various existing methodology. Unified-CNN is developed through improvising CNN. It introduces a novel module at the convolution layer to aim for a high-level feature map in order to get a high prediction. RRS (Random Region Selection) algorithm is used as the data augmentation approach to select the boundary region of the affected area; further robust model training is designed and optimized for process to make optimal.

{"title": "Determining the Optimal Cut-Off Values of Serum E2 and FSH for Evaluating the Menopausal Status of Breast Cancer Patients in a Southern Chinese Population.", "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) is one of universal phenomena in breast cancer (BC) patients, and it causes difficulties in evaluating the actual menopausal status which is important for the oncologists to choose appropriate treatment. Currently, serum estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are the most commonly used clinical parameters for the assessment of menopausal status in BC patients. However, the optimal cut-off points of serum E2 and FSH have little been explored in southern Chinese population.\nThis study is aimed to determine the optimal cut-off values of the serum E2 and FSH levels for evaluating the menopausal status of BC patients in a southern Chinese population.\nA retrospective analysis was done among a total of 206 patients with BC from a southern Chinese area. The data of serum E2, FSH, and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were collected and analyzed for the comparison purpose. The receiver-operating curve (ROC) was generated to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the three biomarkers in discriminating the menopausal status of BC patients. The optimal cut-off values were determined according to the Youden index and then compared with the recommended reference values by the Chinese Anti-cancer Association (CACA) and those recommended by the manufacturers.\nThe areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) of E2, FSH, and LH were 0.846 (95% CI: 0.790-0.903), 0.781 (95% CI: 0.714-0.847) and 0.608 (95% CI: 0.526-0.690), respectively. The optimal cut-off values were 130.0\u2009pg/mL for E2, 23.325\u2009IU/L for FSH, and 11.625\u2009IU/L for LH with a maximum of the Youden index. When E2, FSH, and LH were used in combination for ROC analysis, the AUC increased to 0.847 (95% CI: 0.790-0.904), which was higher than that of any other biomarker alone. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of E2 and FSH were 91.6% and 73.70% and 94.4% and 58.6%, respectively, in comparison with 85.0% and 75.80% and 76.6% and 65.7% according to the CACA-recommended cut-off points, or 92.5% and 68.7% and 96.3% and 53.5% according to the manufacturer recommended cut-off points.\nConsidering the sensitivity and specificity of serum E2 and FSH for assessing the menopausal status, the optimal cut-off values determined in the present study were similar to the manufacturer's recommendations, but obviously superior to the cut-off points suggested by CACA. These cut-off points calculated in this study seem to be valuable in southern Chinese population and might be used by clinicians to make a correct medical decision for BC patients who would benefit from endocrine therapy of aromatase inhibitor (AI).", "journal": "Disease markers", "date": "2022-09-02", "authors": ["LuYang", "RucaiLi", "MengsiYu", "FenHuang", "JiangzhengZeng", "YandaLu", "ChangchengYang"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/8716160\n10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2017.01.01\n10.2147/CMAR.S173099\n10.1016/j.ejso.2015.10.015\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2019.188315\n10.1186/1471-2407-11-364\n10.1200/JCO.2006.07.2793\n10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.04.10\n10.1093/humupd/dmm020\n10.1016/j.maturitas.2010.04.015\n10.1186/s12916-015-0439-8\n10.1016/j.ejso.2008.01.011\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61074-1\n10.1016/S1470-2045(10)70257-6\n10.2174/1389557517666171101100902\n10.1371/journal.pone.0230681\n10.1200/JCO.2005.09.121\n10.1097/GME.0000000000000221\n10.1016/j.ecl.2015.05.010\n10.1016/bs.acc.2018.06.001\n10.2147/CMAR.S269249\n10.1097/01.gme.0000198489.49618.96\n10.1016/j.joca.2013.10.020\n10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.03.100"}

However, the clinical significance of patient-reported cognitive symptoms early in survivorship can be unclear. We used a machine learning approach to determine the association of persistent self-reported cognitive symptoms two years after diagnosis and neurocognitive test performance in a prospective cohort of older breast cancer survivors.\nWe enrolled breast cancer survivors with non-metastatic disease (n\u00a0=\u00a0435) and age- and education-matched non-cancer controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0441) between August 2010 and December 2017 and followed until January 2020; we excluded women with neurological disease and all women passed a cognitive screen at enrollment. Women completed the FACT-Cog Perceived Cognitive Impairment (PCI) scale and neurocognitive tests of attention, processing speed, executive function, learning, memory and visuospatial ability, and timed activities of daily living assessments at enrollment (pre-systemic treatment) and annually to 24\u00a0months, for a total of 59 individual neurocognitive measures. We defined persistent self-reported cognitive decline as clinically meaningful decline (3.7+ points) on the PCI scale from enrollment to twelve months with persistence to 24\u00a0months. Analysis used four machine learning models based on data for change scores (baseline to twelve months) on the 59 neurocognitive measures and measures of depression, anxiety, and fatigue to determine a set of variables that distinguished the 24-month persistent cognitive decline group from non-cancer controls or from survivors without decline.\nThe sample of survivors and controls ranged in age from were ages 60-89. Thirty-three percent of survivors had self-reported cognitive decline at twelve months and two-thirds continued to have persistent decline to 24\u00a0months (n\u00a0=\u00a060). Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models distinguished survivors with persistent self-reported declines from controls (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.736) and survivors without decline (n\u00a0=\u00a0147; AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.744). The variables that separated groups were predominantly neurocognitive test performance change scores, including declines in list learning, verbal fluency, and attention measures.\nMachine learning may be useful to further our understanding of cancer-related cognitive decline.

{"title": "Circular RNA circWWC3 augments breast cancer progression through promoting M2 macrophage polarization and tumor immune escape via regulating the expression and secretion of IL-4.", "abstract": "Interaction between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to promote tumor progression and metastasis. As the most abundant immune cells in TME, macrophages can be polarized into M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which further promote tumor progression. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms of TAM polarization in TME are still largely unknown. In the present study, we revealed that circular RNA circWWC3 could up-regulate the expression and secretion of IL-4 in breast cancer cells. Enhanced secretion of IL-4 from breast cancer cells could augment the M2-like polarization of macrophages in TME, which further promotes the migration of breast cancer cells. In addition, increased secretion of IL-4 from breast cancer cells could induce the expression PD-L1 in M2 macrophages. Moreover, up-regulated IL-4 also enhanced the expression of PD-L1 in breast cancer cells, which further facilitates breast cancer immune evasion. Though analyzing the expression of circWWC3, IL-4, PD-L1, and CD163 in 140 cases of breast cancer tissues, we found that high expression of circWWC3 was associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival of breast cancer patients.

{"title": "Multiresolution-Based Singular Value Decomposition Approach for Breast Cancer Image Classification.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer that can strike at any age; the higher the age, the greater the risk. The presence of malignant tissue has become more frequent in women. Although medical therapy has improved breast cancer diagnostic and treatment methods, still the death rate remains high due to failure of diagnosing breast cancer in its early stages. A classification approach for mammography images based on nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) is proposed in order to investigate it. The proposed method uses multiresolution NSCT decomposition to the region of interest (ROI) of mammography images and then uses Z-moments for extracting features from the NSCT-decomposed images. The matrix is formed by the components that are extracted from the region of interest and are then subjected to singular value decomposition (SVD) in order to remove the essential features that can generalize globally. The method employs a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm to categorize mammography pictures into normal, benign, and malignant and to identify and classify the breast lesions. The accuracy of the proposed model is 96.76 percent, and the training time is greatly decreased, as evident from the experiments performed. The paper also focuses on conducting the feature extraction experiments using morphological spectroscopy. The experiment combines 16 different algorithms with 4 classification methods for achieving exceptional accuracy and time efficiency outcomes as compared to other existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "journal": "BioMed research international", "date": "2022-08-23", "authors": ["SumanMann", "Amit KumarBindal", "ArchanaBalyan", "VijayShukla", "ZatinGupta", "VivekTomar", "ShahajanMiah"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/6392206\n10.1109/ICPR.2014.164\n10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669897\n10.1109/CANCERCARE.2018.8618178\n10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941543\n10.1109/CANCERCARE.2018.8618213\n10.1109/ELNANO50318.2020.9088908\n10.1109/RCIS.2016.7549371\n10.1109/SIU53274.2021.9477992\n10.1109/PN50013.2020.9166986\n10.1109/TBME.2015.2395812\n10.1109/BSB.2016.7552134\n10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037549\n10.1108/wje-10-2020-0533\n10.1109/TBME.2017.2665602\n10.1016/j.imu.2021.100535\n10.1109/10.730440\n10.1155/2021/6455592\n10.1109/TMI.2014.2304959\n10.1155/2021/7548329\n10.1117/1.JEI.31.4.041206\n10.1007/s00530-022-00918-6\n10.1155/2021/5760660\n10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2481940\n10.1155/2021/3688881\n10.1109/CloudTech49835.2020.9365890\n10.1155/2021/4242646\n10.1093/jrr/rry095\n10.1155/2021/4019358\n10.1007/s10710-020-09396-z\n10.1155/2021/8081276"}

{"title": "The potential of predictive and prognostic breast MRI\u00a0(P2-bMRI).", "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important part of breast cancer diagnosis and multimodal workup. It provides unsurpassed soft tissue contrast to analyse the underlying pathophysiology, and it is adopted for a variety of clinical indications. Predictive and prognostic breast MRI (P2-bMRI) is an emerging application next to these indications. The general objective of P2-bMRI is to provide predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers in order to support personalisation of breast cancer treatment. We believe P2-bMRI has a great clinical potential, thanks to the in vivo examination of the whole tumour and of the surrounding tissue, establishing a link between pathophysiology and response to therapy (prediction) as well as patient outcome (prognostication). The tools used for P2-bMRI cover a wide spectrum: standard and advanced multiparametric pulse sequences; structured reporting criteria (for instance BI-RADS descriptors); artificial intelligence methods, including machine learning (with emphasis on radiomics data analysis); and deep learning that have shown compelling potential for this purpose.

We aimed to develop and validate a Siamese multi-task network (SMTN) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) based on longitudinal ultrasound images at the early stage of NACT.\nIn this multicentre, retrospective cohort study, a total of 393 patients with biopsy-proven HER2-positive breast cancer were retrospectively enrolled from three hospitals in china between December 16, 2013 and March 05, 2021, and allocated into a training cohort and two external validation cohorts. Patients receiving full cycles of NACT and with surgical pathological results available were eligible for inclusion. The key exclusion criteria were missing ultrasound images and/or clinicopathological characteristics. The proposed SMTN consists of two subnetworks that could be joined at multiple layers, which allowed for the integration of multi-scale features and extraction of dynamic information from longitudinal ultrasound images before and after the first /second cycles of NACT. We constructed the clinical model as a baseline using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Then the performance of SMTN was evaluated and compared with the clinical model.\nThe training cohort, comprising 215 patients, were selected from Yunnan Cancer Hospital. The two independent external validation cohorts, comprising 95 and 83 patients, were selected from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, and Shanxi Cancer Hospital, respectively. The SMTN yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.986 (95% CI: 0.977-0.995), 0.902 (95%CI: 0.856-0.948), and 0.957 (95%CI: 0.924-0.990) in the training cohort and two external validation cohorts, respectively, which were significantly higher than that those of the clinical model (AUC: 0.524-0.588, \nThe SMTN was able to predict pCR in the early-stage of NACT for HER2-positive breast cancer patients, which could guide clinicians in adjusting treatment regimes.\nKey-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (No.2021B0101420006); National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.82071892, 82171920); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Image Analysis and Application (No.2022B1212010011); the National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China (No.82102019, 82001986); Project Funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No.2020M682643); the Outstanding Youth Science Foundation of Yunnan Basic Research Project (202101AW070001); Scientific research fund project of Department of Education of Yunnan Province(2022J0249).

Risk of VFs was higher in subjects who were untreated as compared to those treated with bone-active drugs (32/184 vs. 22/383; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). Specifically, fracture risk was significantly decreased by denosumab [odds ratio (OR) 0.22; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001] and zoledronate (OR 0.27; P\u2009=\u20090.035), but not by oral BPs (P\u2009=\u20090.317). These data suggest that in real-world clinical practice, denosumab and zoledronate can reduce AI-related risk of VFs after only 24\u00a0months of treatment.", "journal": "Calcified tissue international", "date": "2022-07-29", "authors": ["GherardoMazziotti", "RebeccaPedersini", "WalterVena", "DeborahCosentini", "FlaminiaCarrone", "StellaPigni", "Edda LSimoncini", "RosalbaTorrisi", "AlbertoZambelli", "DavideFarina", "LucaBalzarini", "Andrea GLania", "AlfredoBerruti"], "doi": "10.1007/s00223-022-01011-w\n10.1016/j.jbo.2017.03.001\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61074-1\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.02.028\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2008.07.013\n10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17666-6\n10.1007/s00198-020-05804-3\n10.1016/j.bone.2017.01.013\n10.4065/mcp.2010.0082\n10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.7.1254\n10.1200/JCO.19.01696\n10.1007/s10549-020-05640-3\n10.1016/j.metabol.2021.154962\n10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61602-X\n10.4081/reumatismo.2016.870\n10.1200/JCO.20.00434\n10.1016/j.jbo.2022.100421\n10.1007/s00198-013-2567-3\n10.1007/s12020-012-9691-2\n10.1007/s11657-019-0577-2\n10.1016/j.bone.2005.04.003\n10.1016/j.jocd.2013.08.004\n10.1007/s00198-007-0543-5\n10.1007/s00198-004-1691-5\n10.1530/EJE-15-0118\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.11080\n10.1038/s41574-022-00649-8\n10.1002/jbmr.4250\n10.1016/j.bone.2007.06.004\n10.1002/jbmr.3886\n10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60995-3\n10.2147/OTT.S115058\n10.1093/annonc/mdq217\n10.3389/fphar.2017.00632\n10.1080/00365513.2021.1929447\n10.1007/s40266-016-0344-7\n10.1056/NEJMoa067312\n10.1210/jc.2019-00192\n10.5414/CP202903\n10.1007/s00223-012-9643-0\n10.1016/j.bone.2017.08.003\n10.2174/1871530321666210708142127"}
{"title": "Cancer Treatment-Induced Bone Loss: Role of Denosumab in Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer.", "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic agents, endocrine therapy and radiotherapy used in the management of breast cancer are known to cause decreased bone mineral density, and thus, increased incidence of fractures. A majority (~60%) of the breast cancer patients in India are either estrogen (ER) or progesterone hormone receptor (PR) positive. Adjuvant treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is the treatment mainstay for hormone-sensitive disease in postmenopausal (PM) women, with reduced bone mineral density (BMD), which results in increased fracture rates. Zoledronic acid, alendronate, risedronate and denosumab have been the agents of choice for managing bone loss. Denosumab 60 mg is approved for gaining bone mass in women with breast cancer who are at high risk for fracture following adjuvant AI treatment. The phase III HALT-BC data indicate an improvement in BMD with denosumab and a 50% reduction in clinical fractures, with significant improvements seen at the lumbar spine, distal third of the radius, and total hip. Denosumab has several advantages over other bone modifying agents such as subcutaneous self-administration by the patient themselves, no requirement of hospitalization, no dose modifications in renal impairment, and low incidence of acute phase anaphylactic reactions.

All the images were acquired and selected by specialized breast-imaging radiologists and the nature of each node (benign or malignant) was assessed through a strict clinical protocol using ultrasound-guided biopsies.\nA total of 180 new images from 154 different patients were recruited: 71 images (10 cases and 61 controls) were used to retrain the old model and 109 images (36 cases and 73 controls) were used to evaluate its performance. The achieved accuracy of the proposed method was 92.7% with 77.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity at the optimal cut-off point. In comparison, the visual node inspection made by radiologists from ultrasound images reached 69.7% accuracy with 41.7% sensitivity and 83.6% specificity.\nThe results obtained in this study show the potential of the proposed techniques to differentiate between malignant lymph nodes and benign nodes affected by reactive changes due to COVID-19 vaccination.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for independent risk factors for SPM. We also calculated the HR of each specific cancer type and the latency time to specific SPMs. The risk of SPM was statistically significantly higher in patients with adjuvant RT than in patients without adjuvant RT (adjusted HR [aHR]: 1.105, 95% CI: 1.013-1.206).

{"title": "Potential Determinants for Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia in Patients With Breast Cancer Using Interpretable Machine Learning Approach.", "abstract": "Radiation-induced lymphopenia is known for its survival significance in patients with breast cancer treated with radiation therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of radiotherapy on lymphocytes by applying machine learning strategies. We used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) to predict the event of lymphopenia (grade\u22651) and conduced an independent validation. Then, we induced feature attribution analysis (Shapley additive explanation, SHAP) in explaining the XGboost models to explore the directional contribution of each feature to lymphopenia. Finally, we implemented the proof-of-concept clinical validation. The results showed that the XGboost models had rigorous generalization performances (accuracies 0.764 and ROC-AUC 0.841, respectively) in the independent cohort. The baseline lymphocyte counts are the most protective feature (SHAP = 5.226, direction of SHAP = -0.964). Baseline platelets and monocytes also played important protective roles. The usage of taxane only chemotherapy was less risk on lymphopenia than the combination of anthracycline and taxane. By the contribution analysis of dose, we identified that firstly lymphocytes were sensitive to a radiation dose less than 4Gy; secondly the irradiation volume was more important in promoting lymphopenia than the irradiation dose; thirdly the irradiation dose promoted the event of lymphopenia when the irradiation volume was fixed. Overall, our findings paved the way to clarifying the radiation dose volume effect. To avoid radiation-induced lymphopenia, irradiation volume should be kept to a minimum during the planning process, as long as the target coverage is not compromised.", "journal": "Frontiers in immunology", "date": "2022-07-09", "authors": ["HaoYu", "FangChen", "Ka-OnLam", "LiYang", "YangWang", "Jian-YueJin", "AyaEi Helali", "Feng-Ming SpringKong"], "doi": "10.3389/fimmu.2022.768811\n10.7150/thno.43539\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.01679\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2016.211\n10.2307/3577549\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.04.009\n10.1016/S0009-9260(87)80032-6\n10.1186/1471-2407-11-64\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.05.037\n10.1007/s11060-015-2037-1\n10.1097/COC.0b013e3182940ff9\n10.1016/j.critrevonc.2018.01.003\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2015.11.013\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.02.633\n10.1016/j.radonc.2019.12.008\n10.3109/07357907.2012.762780\n10.1016/j.radonc.2019.11.014\n10.1016/j.adro.2020.03.021\n10.1016/j.acra.2019.07.030\n10.1016/j.omtn.2020.08.022\n10.1634/theoncologist.9-90005-31\n10.1182/blood-2018-09-873125\n10.1111/trf.16175\n10.1016/j.bj.2017.06.003\n10.1016/j.radonc.2020.02.015\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.04.025\n10.3389/fonc.2019.01488\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.10.046\n10.1002/onco.13533\n10.1016/j.jtho.2020.06.008\n10.3816/CBC.2008.n.041\n10.21037/atm-21-2150\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6600347"}
{"title": "Lessons learned: the first consecutive 1000 patients of the CCCMunich", "abstract": "In 2016, the University of Munich Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) was implemented to initiate a precision oncology program. This review of cases was conducted to assess clinical implications and functionality of the program, to identify current limitations and to inform future directions of these efforts.\nCharts, molecular profiles, and tumor board decisions of the first 1000 consecutive cases (01/2016-03/2020) were reviewed. Descriptive statistics were applied to describe relevant findings.\nOf the first 1000 patients presented to the MTB; 914 patients received comprehensive genomic profiling. Median age of patients was 56\u00a0years and 58% were female. The most prevalent diagnoses were breast (16%) and colorectal cancer (10%). Different types of targeted or genome-wide sequencing assays were used; most of them offered by the local department of pathology. Testing was technically successful in 88%. In 41% of cases, a genomic alteration triggered a therapeutic recommendation. The fraction of patients receiving a tumor board recommendation differed significantly between malignancies ranging from over 50% in breast or biliary tract to less than 30% in pancreatic cancers. Based on a retrospective chart review, 17% of patients with an MTB recommendation received appropriate treatment.\nBased on these retrospective analyses, patients with certain malignancies (breast and biliary tract cancer) tend to be more likely to have actionable variants. The low rate of therapeutic implementation (17% of patients receiving a tumor board recommendation) underscores the importance of meticulous follow-up for these patients and ensuring broad access to innovative therapies for patients receiving molecular tumor profiling.", "journal": "Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology", "date": "2022-07-08", "authors": ["KathrinHeinrich", "LisaMiller-Phillips", "FrankZiemann", "KorbinianHasselmann", "KatharinaR\u00fchlmann", "MadeleineFlach", "DorottyaBiro", "Michaelvon Bergwelt-Baildon", "JulianHolch", "TobiasHerold", "Louisavon Baumgarten", "Philipp AGreif", "IrmelaJeremias", "RachelWuerstlein", "JozefinaCasuscelli", "ChristineSpitzweg", "MaxSeidensticker", "BernhardRenz", "StefanieCorradini", "PhilippBaumeister", "ElisabettaGoni", "AmandaTufman", "AndreasJung", "J\u00f6rgKumbrink", "ThomasKirchner", "FrederickKlauschen", "Klaus HMetzeler", "VolkerHeinemann", "C BenediktWestphalen"], "doi": "10.1007/s00432-022-04165-0\n10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30109-1\n10.2217/fon-2020-0429\n10.1016/j.plabm.2020.e00174\n10.1200/PO.19.00359\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0448\n10.1200/PO.19.00398\n10.1056/NEJMoa1714448\n10.1056/NEJMoa2005653\n10.1016/j.annonc.2021.09.019\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.02.018\n10.1002/ijc.30828\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-0126\n10.1016/j.cell.2016.12.015\n10.1038/s41467-020-18613-3\n10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00188-6\n10.1002/ijc.32358\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-16-1396\n10.1093/annonc/mdy263\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.186\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.07.014\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0161\n10.1016/j.ejca.2020.12.024\n10.1002/pon.5282\n10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0405\n10.1200/JCO.2015.61.5997\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.2129\n10.1056/NEJMoa1214886\n10.1056/NEJMoa2103695\n10.1056/NEJMoa1112302\n10.1016/j.trecan.2017.12.004\n10.1016/S2213-8587(21)00120-0\n10.1007/s00404-020-05881-z\n10.3390/diagnostics11040733\n10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0097\n10.1093/annonc/mdz088\n10.1093/annonc/mdz080\n10.1093/annonc/mdw235\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.10.013\n10.7150/thno.36884\n10.1056/NEJMoa2005651"}

The tumoral and peritumoral volumes of interest (VOIs) were segmented and MRI features were extracted. The radiomic features were filtered via a random forest algorithm, and a supporting vector machine was used for modeling. The receiver operator characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the performance of the radiomics-based classifiers.\nFor each MRI sequence, a total of 863 radiomic features were extracted and the top 30 features were selected for model construction. The radiomic classifiers of tumoral VOI and peritumoral VOI were both promising for predicting pCR, with AUCs of 0.96 and 0.97 in the training cohort and 0.89 and 0.78 in the validation cohort, respectively. The tumoral + peritumoral VOI radiomic model could further improve the predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.98 and 0.92 in the training and validation cohorts.\nThe tumoral and peritumoral multiparametric MRI radiomics model can promisingly predict pCR in breast cancer using MRI images before surgery.

Radiomics extracts a huge number of medical imaging features revealing key components of tumor phenotype that can be linked to genomic pathways. The multi-dimensional nature of radiomics requires highly accurate and reliable machine-learning methods to create predictive models for classification or therapy response assessment.Multi-parametric breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used for dense breast imaging as well for screening in high-risk patients and has shown its potential to improve clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. For this reason, the application of ML techniques to breast MRI, in particular to multi-parametric imaging, is rapidly expanding and enhancing both diagnostic and prognostic power. In this review we will focus on the recent literature related to the use of ML in multi-parametric breast MRI for tumor classification and differentiation of molecular subtypes. Indeed, at present, different models and approaches have been employed for this task, requiring a detailed description of the advantages and drawbacks of each technique and a general overview of their performances.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2022-07-01", "authors": ["LuisaAltabella", "GiulioBenetti", "LuciaCamera", "GiuseppeCardano", "StefaniaMontemezzi", "CarloCavedon"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/ac7d8f"}

Given the vast amount of data collected during cancer therapy, there is significant concern in leveraging the algorithms and technologies available with the underlying goal of improving oncologic care. Radiologists will attain better precision and effectiveness with the advent of AI technology, making machine-assisted medical services a valuable and important option for future oncologic medical care. As a result, it is critical to figure out which specific radiology activities are best positioned to gain from AI and radiomics models and methods of oncologic imaging, while also considering the algorithms' capabilities and constraints. Our purpose is to overview the current evidence and future prospects of AI and radiomics algorithms used in oncologic imaging efforts with an emphasis on the three most frequent cancers worldwide, i.e., lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer.

{"title": "Combining the strengths of radiologists and AI for breast cancer screening: a retrospective analysis.", "abstract": "We propose a decision-referral approach for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the breast-cancer screening pathway, whereby the algorithm makes predictions on the basis of its quantification of uncertainty. Algorithmic assessments with high certainty are done automatically, whereas assessments with lower certainty are referred to the radiologist. This two-part AI system can triage normal mammography exams and provide post-hoc cancer detection to maintain a high degree of sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of this AI system on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original radiologist decision.\nWe used a retrospective dataset consisting of 1\u2008193\u2008197 full-field, digital mammography studies carried out between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2020, from eight screening sites participating in the German national breast-cancer screening programme. We derived an internal-test dataset from six screening sites (1670 screen-detected cancers and 19\u2008997 normal mammography exams), and an external-test dataset of breast cancer screening exams (2793 screen-detected cancers and 80\u2008058 normal exams) from two additional screening sites to evaluate the performance of an AI algorithm on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original individual radiologist decision at the point-of-screen reading ahead of the consensus conference. Different configurations of the AI algorithm were evaluated. To account for the enrichment of the datasets caused by oversampling cancer cases, weights were applied to reflect the actual distribution of study types in the screening programme. Triaging performance was evaluated as the rate of exams correctly identified as normal. Sensitivity across clinically relevant subgroups, screening sites, and device manufacturers was compared between standalone AI, the radiologist, and decision referral. We present receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC (AUROC) to evaluate AI-system performance over its entire operating range. Comparison with radiologists and subgroup analysis was based on sensitivity and specificity at clinically relevant configurations.\nThe exemplary configuration of the AI system in standalone mode achieved a sensitivity of 84\u00b72% (95% CI 82\u00b74-85\u00b78) and a specificity of 89\u00b75% (89\u00b70-89\u00b79) on internal-test data, and a sensitivity of 84\u00b76% (83\u00b73-85\u00b79) and a specificity of 91\u00b73% (91\u00b71-91\u00b75) on external-test data, but was less accurate than the average unaided radiologist. By contrast, the simulated decision-referral approach significantly improved upon radiologist sensitivity by 2\u00b76 percentage points and specificity by 1\u00b70 percentage points, corresponding to a triaging performance at 63\u00b70% on the external dataset; the AUROC was 0\u00b7982 (95% CI 0\u00b7978-0\u00b7986) on the subset of studies assessed by AI, surpassing radiologist performance. The decision-referral approach also yielded significant increases in sensitivity for a number of clinically relevant subgroups, including subgroups of small lesion sizes and invasive carcinomas. Sensitivity of the decision-referral approach was consistent across the eight included screening sites and three device manufacturers.\nThe decision-referral approach leverages the strengths of both the radiologist and AI, demonstrating improvements in sensitivity and specificity surpassing that of the individual radiologist and of the standalone AI system. This approach has the potential to improve the screening accuracy of radiologists, is adaptive to the requirements of screening, and could allow for the reduction of workload ahead of the consensus conference, without discarding the generalised knowledge of radiologists.\nVara.", "journal": "The Lancet.

{"title": "Radiomics in Oncological PET Imaging: A Systematic Review-Part 1, Supradiaphragmatic Cancers.", "abstract": "Radiomics is an upcoming field in nuclear oncology, both promising and technically challenging. To summarize the already undertaken work on supradiaphragmatic neoplasia and assess its quality, we performed a literature search in the PubMed database up to 18 February 2022. Inclusion criteria were: studies based on human data; at least one specified tumor type; supradiaphragmatic malignancy; performing radiomics on PET imaging. Exclusion criteria were: studies only based on phantom or animal data; technical articles without a clinically oriented question; fewer than 30 patients in the training cohort. A review database containing PMID, year of publication, cancer type, and quality criteria (number of patients, retrospective or prospective nature, independent validation cohort) was constructed. A total of 220 studies met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 119 (54.1%) studies included more than 100 patients, 21 studies (9.5%) were based on prospectively acquired data, and 91 (41.4%) used an independent validation set. Most studies focused on prognostic and treatment response objectives. Because the textural parameters and methods employed are very different from one article to another, it is complicated to aggregate and compare articles.

{"title": "MRI characteristics of breast edema for assessing axillary lymph node burden in early-stage breast cancer: a retrospective bicentric study.", "abstract": "To investigate whether breast edema characteristics at preoperative T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) could help evaluate axillary lymph node (ALN) burden in patients with early-stage breast cancer.\nThis retrospective study included women with clinical T1 and T2 stage breast cancer and preoperative MRI examination in two independent cohorts from May 2014 to December 2020. Low (< 3 LNs+) and high (\u2265 3 LNs+) pathological ALN (pALN) burden were recorded as endpoint. Breast edema score (BES) was evaluated at T2WI. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed by the logistic regression model. The added predictive value of BES was examined utilizing the area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).\nA total of 1092 patients were included in this study. BES was identified as the independent predictor of pALN burden in primary (n = 677) and validation (n = 415) cohorts. The analysis using MRI-ALN status showed that BES significantly improved the predictive performance of pALN burden (AUC: 0.65 vs 0.71, p < 0.001; IDI = 0.045, p < 0.001; continuous NRI = 0.159, p = 0.050). These results were confirmed in the validation cohort (AUC: 0.64 vs 0.69, p = 0.009; IDI = 0.050, p < 0.001; continuous NRI = 0.213, p = 0.047). Furthermore, BES was positively correlated with biologically invasive clinicopathological factors (p < 0.05).\nIn individuals with early-stage breast cancer, preoperative MRI characteristics of breast edema could be a promising predictor for pALN burden, which may aid in treatment planning.\n\u2022 In this retrospective study of 1092 patients with early-stage breast cancer from two cohorts, the MRI characteristic of breast edema has independent and additive predictive value for assessing axillary lymph node burden. \u2022 Breast edema characteristics at T2WI positively correlated with biologically invasive clinicopathological factors, which may be useful for preoperative diagnosis and treatment planning for individual patients with breast cancer.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2022-06-16", "authors": ["ZeyanXu", "YingyingDing", "KeZhao", "ChuHan", "ZhenweiShi", "YanfenCui", "ChunlingLiu", "HuanLin", "XipengPan", "PinxiongLi", "MingleiChen", "HuihuiWang", "XiaohuiDeng", "ChanghongLiang", "YuXie", "ZaiyiLiu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00330-022-08896-z\n10.1148/radiol.2020192534\n10.1001/jama.2011.90\n10.1001/jama.2017.11470\n10.1200/JCO.21.00934\n10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30580-5\n10.1097/01.sla.0000245472.47748.ec\n10.1056/NEJM199810013391401\n10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70278-4\n10.1007/s00268-012-1623-z\n10.1148/radiol.2021202683\n10.1007/s10549-020-05592-8\n10.1148/radiol.2017171157\n10.1007/s12282-013-0440-z\n10.1007/s12282-014-0572-9\n10.1148/radiol.2021202604\n10.3892/ol.2020.12177\n10.1007/s00330-020-07674-z\n10.1245/s10434-010-0934-2\n10.1007/s12094-019-02162-3\n10.1093/annonc/mdt303\n10.1007/s00268-010-0683-1\n10.1148/radiol.2021210369\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0337\n10.1148/radiol.2016152331\n10.1007/s11547-019-01072-2\n10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.08.020\n10.1007/s00330-021-08330-w\n10.1007/s10549-020-06056-9\n10.1007/s00330-020-07181-1\n10.1111/j.1524-4741.2010.00915.x\n10.1007/s00330-019-06361-y\n10.2353/ajpath.2008.070360\n10.1038/s41598-021-92283-z\n10.1067/j.cpradiol.2018.08.003"}
{"title": "The impact of bone mineral density screening on incident fractures and healthcare resource utilization among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors treated with aromatase inhibitors.", "abstract": "Bone mineral density screening prior to initiating aromatase inhibitor therapy was associated with lower incident bone fractures and healthcare resource utilization among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.\nPostmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (BC) often receive aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. However, AIs induce bone loss and BC survivors are at an increased risk of bone fractures. This study determined whether receipt of baseline dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening is associated with decreased incident fractures and lower healthcare resource utilization.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 22,713 stage 0-III primary BC survivors who received AI therapy\u2009\u2264\u20091\u00a0year prior to BC diagnosis from the Medicare-Linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results database. We categorized DXA screening for those who had a procedural claim within 12\u00a0months prior through 6\u00a0months after first AI claim. We used propensity score methods to assess the association of DXA screening with bone fractures and health resource utilization.\nOf the study cohort, 62% received a DXA screening. Women with comorbid dementia, renal disease, and congestive heart failure were less likely to receive a DXA. After adjusting for confounders, BC survivors who received a DXA had a 32% decreased risk of any bone fracture compared to those who did not (hazard ratio (HR): 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-0.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

{"title": "Targeted Therapy of B7 Family Checkpoints as an Innovative Approach to Overcome Cancer Therapy Resistance: A Review from Chemotherapy to Immunotherapy.", "abstract": "It is estimated that there were 18.1 million cancer cases worldwide in 2018, with about 9 million deaths. Proper diagnosis of cancer is essential for its effective treatment because each type of cancer requires a specific treatment procedure. Cancer therapy includes one or more approaches such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. In recent years, immunotherapy has received much attention and immune checkpoint molecules have been used to treat several cancers. These molecules are involved in regulating the activity of T lymphocytes. Accumulated evidence shows that targeting immune checkpoint regulators like PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are significantly useful in treating cancers. According to studies, these molecules also have pivotal roles in the chemoresistance of cancer cells. Considering these findings, the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy can help to treat cancer with a more efficient approach. Among immune checkpoint molecules, the B7 family checkpoints have been studied in various cancer types such as breast cancer, myeloma, and lymphoma. In these cancers, they cause the cells to become resistant to the chemotherapeutic agents. Discovering the exact signaling pathways and selective targeting of these checkpoint molecules may provide a promising avenue to overcome cancer development and therapy resistance. Highlights: (1) The development of resistance to cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy is the main obstacle to improving the outcome of these anti-cancer therapies. (2) Recent investigations have described the involvement of immune checkpoint molecules in the development of cancer therapy resistance. (3) In the present study, the molecular participation of the B7 immune checkpoint family in anticancer therapies has been highlighted. (4) Targeting these immune checkpoint molecules may be considered an efficient approach to overcoming this obstacle.", "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2022-06-11", "authors": ["BitaAmir Taghavi", "NazilaAlizadeh", "HosseinSaeedi", "NooraKarim Ahangar", "AfshinDerakhshani", "KhalilHajiasgharzadeh", "NicolaSilvestris", "BehzadBaradaran", "OronzoBrunetti"], "doi": "10.3390/molecules27113545\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.1002/ijc.31937\n10.4103/jcar.jcar_14_21\n10.1080/14712598.2020.1815704\n10.2217/cns-2018-0007\n10.3390/biomedicines9040373\n10.1038/sj.cgt.7700540\n10.3390/cancers13102414\n10.1038/nri3405\n10.1134/S1068162019040101\n10.3390/ijms21145034\n10.1134/S1068162019050091\n10.1007/s40257-018-0389-y\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-3001\n10.1038/nri2326\n10.1007/s00432-017-2346-1\n10.1038/jid.2013.114\n10.1007/s11060-012-1021-2\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605375\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0536\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-602\n10.1038/modpathol.2010.95\n10.1097/SLA.0b013e3181f1939d\n10.3748/wjg.v12.i3.457\n10.4049/jimmunol.171.9.4650\n10.1038/onc.2012.600\n10.1007/s11060-008-9601-x\n10.1155/2015/326981\n10.1245/s10434-014-4293-2\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3017\n10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa2327\n10.1016/j.intimp.2018.03.020\n10.1111/jop.12586\n10.1080/2162402X.2016.1207841\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1495\n10.1084/jem.20021752\n10.1038/70932\n10.15296/ijwhr.2019.23\n10.1038/ni0502-427\n10.1016/S0888-7543(03)00126-5\n10.1084/jem.181.4.1345\n10.4049/jimmunol.166.12.7300\n10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(200004)30:4<1040::AID-IMMU1040>3.0.CO;2-6\n10.1038/16717\n10.1136/lupus-2016-000146\n10.1038/85339\n10.1186/1471-2407-9-463\n10.1016/j.febslet.2015.06.037\n10.1007/s12032-014-0349-1\n10.1073/pnas.0709802104\n10.1007/s00262-010-0841-1\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0715\n10.1007/s11060-009-0038-7\n10.1016/j.coi.2016.02.006\n10.18632/oncotarget.8784\n10.1111/imr.12243\n10.1172/JCI80010\n10.1038/cr.2017.90\n10.1038/nrm909\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0317\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0072\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-1752\n10.1016/j.molmed.2006.11.001\n10.1182/blood-2002-07-2130\n10.1200/JCO.2003.02.063\n10.1007/s12032-014-0944-1\n10.1016/S1074-7613(03)00152-3\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1504\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-16-0761\n10.1128/JVI.00888-15\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1506\n10.1038/s41598-021-87216-9\n10.18632/oncotarget.16391\n10.1007/s00018-011-0802-7\n10.4049/jimmunol.1103495\n10.1038/ncomms3043\n10.4103/jcar.JCar_16_19\n10.18632/oncotarget.14021\n10.1007/s11010-008-9722-8\n10.4103/jcar.JCar_12_20\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-15-0296\n10.3109/10428194.2012.673228\n10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e01039\n10.1038/s41416-019-0697-x\n10.1038/s41598-019-42303-w\n10.2147/CMAR.S222224\n10.1186/s12935-018-0597-9\n10.1186/bcr2605\n10.4103/jcar.JCar_9_21\n10.1002/jcb.21343\n10.1128/MCB.22.2.680-691.2002\n10.3892/ijo.2015.2962\n10.2147/OTT.S85272\n10.1002/14651858.CD010678.pub2\n10.1002/jat.1734\n10.1371/journal.pone.0060834\n10.12659/MSM.902068\n10.1007/s00216-016-9847-7\n10.1111/pin.12507\n10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03111.x\n10.3892/ijo.2016.3393"}

Furthermore, clinical experience has shown that they are the upstream tasks of pathological classification of breast lesions. Recent advancements in deep learning have made the analyses faster and more accurate. This study aims to develop a deep learning model architecture for breast cancer mass detection and segmentation using the mammography.\nIn this work we proposed a double shot model for mass detection and segmentation simultaneously using a combination of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and LOGO (Local-Global) architectures. Firstly, we adopted YoloV5L6, the state-of-the-art object detection model, to position and crop the breast mass in mammograms with a high resolution; Secondly, to balance training efficiency and segmentation performance, we modified the LOGO training strategy to train the whole images and cropped images on the global and local transformer branches separately. The two branches were then merged to form the final segmentation decision.\nThe proposed YOLO-LOGO model was tested on two independent mammography datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INBreast). The proposed model performs significantly better than previous works. It achieves true positive rate 95.7% and mean average precision 65.0% for mass detection on CBIS-DDSM dataset. Its performance for mass segmentation on CBIS-DDSM dataset is F1-score=74.5% and IoU=64.0%. The similar performance trend is observed in another independent dataset INBreast as well.\nThe proposed model has a higher efficiency and better performance, reduces computational requirements, and improves the versatility and accuracy of computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis.

The authors present an innovative approach for identifying breast cancer using machine learning methods. Compared to current approaches, such as CNN, our particle swarm optimized wavelet neural network (PSOWNN) method appears to be relatively superior. The use of machine learning methods is clearly beneficial in terms of improved performance, efficiency, and quality of images, which are crucial to the most innovative medical applications. According to a comparison of the process's 905 images to those of other illnesses, 98.6% of the disorders are correctly identified. In summary, PSOWNNs, therefore, have a specificity of 98.8%. Furthermore, PSOWNNs have a precision of 98.6%, which means that, despite the high number of women diagnosed with breast cancer, only 830 (95.2%) are diagnosed. In other words, 95.2% of images are correctly classified. PSOWNNs are more accurate than other machine learning algorithms, SVM, KNN, and CNN.", "journal": "Computational intelligence and neuroscience", "date": "2022-05-24", "authors": ["AshkanNomani", "YasamanAnsari", "Mohammad HosseinNasirpour", "ArminMasoumian", "Ehsan SadeghiPour", "AminValizadeh"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/5667264\n10.1093/annonc/mdz051\n10.1371/journal.pone.0207558\n10.1186/bcr1639\n10.1007/s10555-015-9551-7\n10.3390/biomedicines10020300\n10.1080/03630242.2022.2030448\n10.1016/s0046-8177(77)80096-8\n10.1186/bcr2790\n10.1089/jwh.2021.0232\n10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115204\n10.1016/j.matpr.2021.04.241\n10.1016/j.media.2018.03.006\n10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109542\n10.1111/j.1600-0463.2008.00990.x\n10.1016/j.eswa.2013.08.044\n10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106958\n10.1093/eurheartj/ehab745\n10.1177/117693510600200030\n10.1007/s10044-014-0375-9\n10.1158/1055-9965.epi-21-0838\n10.1007/s00521-021-05997-6\n10.1007/s12525-021-00475-2\n10.1145/3234150\n10.1007/s11831-019-09344-w\n10.1097/RTI.0000000000000387\n10.1016/j.neucom.2014.12.032\n10.3390/su9071188\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.10.022\n10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102919\n10.1016/j.asoc.2016.04.012\n10.1587/transcom.2021ebp3035\n10.1007/s11036-020-01717-x\n10.1109/tip.2018.2794207\n10.1016/j.ins.2021.06.016\n10.1109/TITS.2021.3134557\n10.3390/s21155137\n10.1080/10255842.2021.1921164\n10.1038/s41377-022-00714-x\n10.2174/1574893615999200503030350\n10.1155/2021/8542637\n10.1261/rna.069112.118\n10.1111/aos.14928\n10.1016/j.bspc.2013.06.011\n10.1061/(asce)wr.1943-5452.0000099\n10.1080/21681163.2020.1824685\n10.1016/j.artmed.2020.101845\n10.1002/adma.202103646\n10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111090\n10.1016/j.cyto.2022.155873\n10.1038/s41598-021-98851-7\n10.1109/tpel.2022.3153797\n10.7717/peerj-cs.613\n10.3389/fnbot.2022.840594\n10.1016/j.imu.2019.100239\n10.1186/s12874-022-01506-y\n10.1038/s41598-021-04176-w\n10.1080/03772063.2022.2028584\n10.1002/jmri.28082\n10.1007/s12652-022-03713-3\n10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.105205\n10.1155/2019/4179397\n10.3390/app12062828\n10.1109/jbhi.2020.2986376\n10.1080/00207454.2021.1883602\n10.1109/jiot.2020.3007518\n10.22436/jmcs.014.01.03\n10.1155/2021/6653879\n10.22436/jmcs.014.01.04\n10.1007/s00500-019-04507-0\n10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107449\n10.1155/2021/7567870\n10.1155/2021/9995073\n10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110170\n10.1155/2020/4737969\n10.1155/2022/6785707"}

Our goal is to develop a real-time automatic neural network-based tumor contouring process for intraoperative guidance. Segmentation accuracy is evaluated by both pixel-based metrics and expert visual rating.\nThis retrospective study includes 7318 intraoperative ultrasound images acquired from 33 breast cancer patients, randomly split between 80:20 for training and testing. We implement a u-net architecture to label each pixel on ultrasound images as either tumor or healthy breast tissue. Quantitative metrics are calculated to evaluate the model's accuracy. Contour quality and usability are also assessed by fellowship-trained breast radiologists and surgical oncologists. Additionally, the viability of using our u-net model in an existing surgical navigation system is evaluated by measuring the segmentation frame rate.\nThe mean dice similarity coefficient of our u-net model is 0.78, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0.94, sensitivity of 0.95, and specificity of 0.67. Expert visual ratings are positive, with 93% of responses rating tumor contour quality at or above 7/10, and 75% of responses rating contour quality at or above 8/10. Real-time tumor segmentation achieved a frame rate of 16 frames-per-second, sufficient for clinical use.\nNeural networks trained with intraoperative ultrasound images provide consistent tumor segmentations that are well received by clinicians.

The advent of digital pathology (DP) and an increase in computational power have led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools that can assist pathologists and pulmonologists in improving clinical workflow and patient management. While previous works have explored the advances in computational approaches for breast, prostate, and head and neck cancers, there has been a growing interest in applying these technologies to lung diseases as well. The application of AI tools on radiology images for better characterization of indeterminate lung nodules, fibrotic lung disease, and lung cancer risk stratification has been well documented. In this article, we discuss methodologies used to build AI tools in lung DP, describing the various hand-crafted and deep learning-based unsupervised feature approaches. Next, we review AI tools across a wide spectrum of lung diseases including cancer, tuberculosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and COVID-19. We discuss the utility of novel imaging biomarkers for different types of clinical problems including quantification of biomarkers like PD-L1, lung disease diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of response to treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. We also look briefly at some emerging applications of AI tools in lung DP such as multimodal data analysis, 3D pathology, and transplant rejection. Lastly, we discuss the future of DP-based AI tools, describing the challenges with regulatory approval, developing reimbursement models, planning clinical deployment, and addressing AI biases. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

{"title": "Microcalcification Discrimination in Mammography Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network: Towards Rapid and Early Breast Cancer Diagnosis.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is among the most common types of cancer in women and under the cases of misdiagnosed, or delayed in treatment, the mortality risk is high. The existence of breast microcalcifications is common in breast cancer patients and they are an effective indicator for early sign of breast cancer. However, microcalcifications are often missed and wrongly classified during screening due to their small sizes and indirect scattering in mammogram images. Motivated by this issue, this project proposes an adaptive transfer learning deep convolutional neural network in segmenting breast mammogram images with calcifications cases for early breast cancer diagnosis and intervention. Mammogram images of breast microcalcifications are utilized to train several deep neural network models and their performance is compared. Image filtering of the region of interest images was conducted to remove possible artifacts and noises to enhance the quality of the images before the training. Different hyperparameters such as epoch, batch size, etc were tuned to obtain the best possible result. In addition, the performance of the proposed fine-tuned hyperparameter of ResNet50 is compared with another state-of-the-art machine learning network such as ResNet34, VGG16, and AlexNet. Confusion matrices were utilized for comparison.

Artificial intelligence-based automated radiotherapy planning strategies have been proposed in lots of cancer sites and are the future of treatment planning. Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) decreases local recurrence probability and improves overall survival, and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) has gradually become the mainstream technique of radiotherapy. However, there are few customized effective automated treatment planning schemes for postmastectomy VMAT so far. This study investigated an artificial intelligence based automated planning using the MD Anderson Cancer Center AutoPlan (MDAP) system and Pinnacle treatment planning system (TPS), to effectively generate high-quality postmastectomy VMAT plans. In this study, 20 patients treated with PMRT were retrospectively investigated, including 10 left- and 10 right-sided postmastectomy patients. Chest wall and the supraclavicular, subclavicular, and internal mammary regions were delineated as target volume by radiation oncologists, and 50 Gy in 25 fractions was prescribed. Organs at risk including heart, spinal cord, left lung, right lung, and lungs were also contoured. All patients were planned with VMAT using 2 arcs. An optimization objective template was summarized based on the dose of clinical plans and requirements from oncologists. Several treatment planning parameters were investigated using an artificial intelligence algorithm, including collimation angle, jaw collimator mode, gantry spacing resolution (GSR), and number of start optimization times. The treatment planning parameters with the best performance or that were most preferred were applied to the automated treatment planning method. Dosimetric indexes of automated treatment plans (autoplans) and manual clinical plans were compared by the paired t-test. The jaw tracking mode, 2-degree GSR, and 3 rounds of optimization were selected in all the PMRT autoplans.

{"title": "Deep learning identification of stiffness markers in breast cancer.", "abstract": "While essential to our understanding of solid tumor progression, the study of cell and tissue mechanics has yet to find traction in the clinic. Determining tissue stiffness, a mechanical property known to promote a malignant phenotype in vitro and in vivo, is not part of the standard algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Instead, clinicians routinely use mammograms to identify malignant lesions and radiographically dense breast tissue is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Whether breast density is related to tumor tissue stiffness, and what cellular and non-cellular components of the tumor contribute the most to its stiffness are not well understood.

Regarding ovarian cancer (OC), despite the standardization of features that can support the discrimination of ovarian masses into benign and malignant, there is a lack of accurate predictive modeling based on ultrasound (US) examination for progression-free survival (PFS). This retrospective observational study analyzed patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who were followed in a tertiary center from 2018 to 2019. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, information about the surgery and post-surgery histopathology were collected. Additionally, we recorded data about US examinations according to the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) classification. Our study aimed to realize a tool to predict 12\u00a0month PFS in patients with OC based on a ML algorithm applied to gynecological ultrasound assessment. Proper feature selection was used to determine an attribute core set. Three different machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RFF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), were then trained and validated with five-fold cross-validation to predict 12\u00a0month PFS. Our analysis included n. 64 patients and 12\u00a0month PFS was achieved by 46/64 patients (71.9%). The attribute core set used to train machine learning algorithms included age, menopause, CA-125 value, histotype, FIGO stage and US characteristics, such as major lesion diameter, side, echogenicity, color score, major solid component diameter, presence of carcinosis. RFF showed the best performance (accuracy 93.7%, precision 90%, recall 90%, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.92).

Patients were treated with daily CBCT images and without online adaptation, prescribing 40.05 Gy in 15 fractions, with four IMRT tangential beams. ESTRO guidelines were followed for the delineation on planning CT (pCT) of organs at risk and targets. For each patient, all the CBCT images were rigidly aligned to pCT: CTV and PTV were manually re-contoured and the original treatment plan was recalculated. Various radiological parameters were measured on CBCT images, to quantify inter-fraction variability present in each RT fraction after the couch shifts compensation. The variation of these parameters was correlated with the variation of V95% of PTV (\u0394V95%) using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. Fractions where \u0394V95% > 2% were considered as adverse events. A logistic regression model was calculated considering the most significant parameter, and its performance was quantified with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\nA total of 75 fractions on 5 patients were analyzed. The body variation between daily CBCT and pCT along the beam axis with the highest MU was identified as the best predictor (\nA novel strategy to identify treatment fractions that may benefit online ART was proposed. After image alignment, the measure of body difference between daily CBCT and pCT can be considered as an indirect estimator of V95% PTV variation: a difference larger than 3 mm will result in a V95% decrease larger than 2%.

Purpose To develop and evaluate a prognostic model combining deep learning of head CT scans and clinical information to predict long-term outcomes after sTBI. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective analysis of two prospectively collected databases. The model-building set included 537 patients (mean age, 40 years \u00b1 17 [SD]; 422 men) from one institution from November 2002 to December 2018. Transfer learning and curriculum learning were applied to a convolutional neural network using admission head CT to predict mortality and unfavorable outcomes (Glasgow Outcomes Scale scores 1-3) at 6 months. This was combined with clinical input for a holistic fusion model. The models were evaluated using an independent internal test set and an external cohort of 220 patients with sTBI (mean age, 39 years \u00b1 17; 166 men) from 18 institutions in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study from February 2014 to April 2018. The models were compared with the International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) model and the predictions of three neurosurgeons.

It is therefore vital to develop effective imaging methods to perform breast screening, diagnosis, and treatment follow-up. Breast MRI is the most efficient method for screening high-risk patients, for breast lesion differentiation and characterization, and for the assessment of response to treatment. Some novel MRI imaging techniques, such as Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging, perfusion imaging, MR Spectroscopy, hybrid PET/MRI imaging, fMRI and ultra-high field MRI imaging offer the capacity to improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI, while reducing unnecessary biopsies. However, any techniques used in breast MRI should be treated with caution, and after a thoughtful consideration of its main strengths and weaknesses. Fast, unenhanced MRI protocols will benefit our patients, improving their overall MRI experience and avoiding the potential risks of contrast media administration.

{"title": "Effective Image Processing and Segmentation-Based Machine Learning Techniques for Diagnosis of Breast Cancer.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women, behind only heart disease. However, despite the high incidence and mortality rates associated with breast cancer, it is still unclear as to what is responsible for its development in the first place. The prevention of breast cancer is not possible with any of the current available methods. Patients who are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at an early stage have a better chance of having a successful treatment and recovery. In the field of breast cancer detection, digital mammography is widely acknowledged to be a highly effective method of detecting the disease early on. We may be able to improve early detection of breast cancer with the use of image processing techniques, thereby boosting our chances of survival and treatment success. This article discusses a breast cancer image processing and machine learning framework that was developed. The input data set for this framework is a sequence of mammography images, which are used as input data. The CLAHE approach is then utilized to improve the overall quality of the photographs by means of image processing. It is called contrast restricted adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and it is an improvement on the original histogram equalization technique. This aids in the removal of noise from photographs while simultaneously improving picture quality. The segmentation of images is the next step in the framework's development. An image is divided into distinct portions at this point because the pixels are labeled at this step. This assists in the identification of objects and the delineation of boundaries. To categorize these preprocessed images, techniques such as fuzzy SVM, Bayesian classifier, and random forest are employed, among others.", "journal": "Computational and mathematical methods in medicine", "date": "2022-04-19", "authors": ["SushovanChaudhury", "Alla NaveenKrishna", "SuneetGupta", "K SakthidasanSankaran", "SamiullahKhan", "KartikSau", "AbhishekRaghuvanshi", "FSammy"], "doi": "10.1155/2022/6841334\n10.1155/2021/9905808\n10.3322/caac.21551\n10.1111/tbj.12681\n10.3389/fgene.2019.00256\n10.1016/j.patrec.2018.11.004\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.04.011\n10.1155/2021/8085530\n10.1155/2022/3955514\n10.1109/ICON.2008.4772644\n10.1007/s10278-009-9257-x\n10.1109/TIM.2010.2051060\n10.5120/1467-1982\n10.1155/2021/6455592\n10.1016/j.ultras.2018.07.006\n10.1145/2442796.2442809\n10.1016/j.ijleo.2018.08.112"}

In addition to the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) technique, functional techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) further characterize and differentiate benign and malignant lesions thus, improving diagnostic accuracy. There is now an increasing clinical usage of MRI breast, including screening in high risk and supplementary screening tools in average-risk patients. MRI is becoming imperative in assisting breast surgeons in planning breast-conserving surgery for preoperative local staging and evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response. Other clinical applications for MRI breast include occult breast cancer detection, investigation of nipple discharge, and breast implant assessment. There is now an abundance of research publications on MRI Breast with several areas that still remain to be explored. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the clinical trends of MRI breast with emphasis on imaging features and interpretation using conventional and advanced techniques.

{"title": "Improving Breast Tumor Segmentation in PET via Attentive Transformation Based Normalization.", "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has become a preferred imaging modality for cancer diagnosis, radiotherapy planning, and treatment responses monitoring. Accurate and automatic tumor segmentation is the fundamental requirement for these clinical applications. Deep convolutional neural networks have become the state-of-the-art in PET tumor segmentation. The normalization process is one of the key components for accelerating network training and improving the performance of the network. However, existing normalization methods either introduce batch noise into the instance PET image by calculating statistics on batch level or introduce background noise into every single pixel by sharing the same learnable parameters spatially. In this paper, we proposed an attentive transformation (AT)-based normalization method for PET tumor segmentation. We exploit the distinguishability of breast tumor in PET images and dynamically generate dedicated and pixel-dependent learnable parameters in normalization via the transformation on a combination of channel-wise and spatial-wise attentive responses. The attentive learnable parameters allow to re-calibrate features pixel-by-pixel to focus on the high-uptake area while attenuating the background noise of PET images. Our experimental results on two real clinical datasets show that the AT-based normalization method improves breast tumor segmentation performance when compared with the existing normalization methods.", "journal": "IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics", "date": "2022-04-05", "authors": ["XiaoyaQiao", "ChunjuanJiang", "PanliLi", "YuanYuan", "QinglongZeng", "LeiBi", "ShaoliSong", "JinmanKim", "David DaganFeng", "QiuHuang"], "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2022.3164570"}

{"title": "Application of Deep Learning in Breast Cancer Imaging.", "abstract": "This review gives an overview of the current state of deep learning research in breast cancer imaging. Breast imaging plays a major role in detecting breast cancer at an earlier stage, as well as monitoring and evaluating breast cancer during treatment. The most commonly used modalities for breast imaging are digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques are used for detection and classification of axillary lymph nodes and distant staging in breast cancer imaging. All of these techniques are currently digitized, enabling the possibility to implement deep learning (DL), a subset of Artificial intelligence, in breast imaging. DL is nowadays embedded in a plethora of different tasks, such as lesion classification and segmentation, image reconstruction and generation, cancer risk prediction, and prediction and assessment of therapy response. Studies show similar and even better performances of DL algorithms compared to radiologists, although it is clear that large trials are needed, especially for ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, to exactly determine the added value of DL in breast cancer imaging. Studies on DL in nuclear medicine techniques are only sparsely available and further research is mandatory.

{"title": "Multi-center evaluation of artificial intelligent imaging and clinical models for predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in breast cancer.", "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) plays an important role in the management of locally advanced breast cancer. It allows for downstaging of tumors, potentially allowing for breast conservation. NAC also allows for in-vivo testing of the tumors' response to chemotherapy and provides important prognostic information. There are currently no clearly defined clinical models that incorporate imaging with clinical data to predict response to NAC. Thus, the aim of this work is to develop a predictive AI model based on routine CT imaging and clinical parameters to predict response to NAC.\nThe CT scans of 324 patients with NAC from multiple centers in Singapore were used in this study. Four different radiomics models were built for predicting pathological complete response (pCR): first two were based on textural features extracted from peri-tumoral and tumoral regions, the third model based on novel space-resolved radiomics which extract feature maps using voxel-based radiomics and the fourth model based on deep learning (DL). Clinical parameters were included to build a final prognostic model.\nThe best performing models were based on space-resolved and DL approaches. Space-resolved radiomics improves the clinical AUCs of pCR prediction from 0.743 (0.650 to 0.831) to 0.775 (0.685 to 0.860) and our DL model improved it from 0.743 (0.650 to 0.831) to 0.772 (0.685 to 0.853). The tumoral radiomics model performs the worst with no improvement of the AUC from the clinical model.

{"title": "Development of intraoperative assessment of margins in breast conserving surgery: a narrative review.", "abstract": "We intend to provide an informative and up-to-date summary on the topic of intraoperative assessment of margins in breast conserving surgery (BCS). Conventional methods as well as cutting-edge technologies are analyzed for their advantages and limitations in the hope that clinicians can turn to this for reference. This review can also offer guidance for technicians in the future design of intraoperative margin assessment tools.\nAchieving negative margins during BCS is one of the vital factors for preventing local recurrence. Conducting intraoperative margin assessment can ensure negative margins to a large extent and possibly relieve patients of the anguish of re-interventions. In recent years, innovative methods for margin assessment during BCS are advancing rapidly. And there is a lack of summary regarding the development of intraoperative margin assessment in BCS.\nA PubMed search with keywords \"intraoperative margin assessment\" and \"breast conserving surgery\" was conducted. Relevant publications were screened manually for its title, abstract and even full text to determine its true relevance. Publications on neo-adjuvant therapy and intraoperative radiotherapy were excluded. References from the searched articles and other supplementary articles were also looked into.\nConventional methods for margin assessment yields stable outcome but its use is limited because of the demand on pathology staff and the trade-off between time and precision. Conventional imaging techniques pass the workload to radiologists at the cost of a significantly low duration of time. Involving artificial intelligence for image-based assessment is a further improvement. However, conventional imaging is inherently flawed in that occult lesions can't show on the image and the showing ones are ambiguous and open to interpretation. Unconventional techniques which base their judgment on cellular composition are more reassuring. Nonetheless, unconventional techniques should be subjected to clinical trials before putting into practice. And studies regarding comparison between conventional methods and unconventional methods are also needed to evaluate their relative efficacy.", "journal": "Gland surgery", "date": "2022-03-05", "authors": ["WanhengLi", "XiruLi"], "doi": "10.21037/gs-21-652\n10.1056/NEJMoa022152\n10.1056/NEJMoa020989\n10.1002/cncr.11580\n10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61629-2\n10.1016/S1470-2045(12)70042-6\n10.12809/hkmj164972\n10.1007/s00268-009-0278-x\n10.1200/JCO.2000.18.8.1668\n10.1245/s10434-014-3480-5\n10.3747/co.23.2989\n10.1245/s10434-016-5516-5\n10.1245/s10434-019-07751-8\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.07.032\n10.1038/s41598-020-74373-6\n10.1038/s41598-019-49951-y\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2007.01.031\n10.1056/NEJMoa1504473\n10.1245/s10434-013-3257-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0168705\n10.1001/jamasurg.2016.4751\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.11.019\n10.1245/s10434-012-2492-2\n10.1007/s10147-015-0827-2\n10.1245/s10434-020-08955-z\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.09.008\n10.1016/j.ejso.2016.11.004\n10.1016/j.clbc.2019.10.004\n10.1245/s10434-015-4906-4\n10.1016/j.breast.2012.10.006\n10.1007/s10549-013-2639-2\n10.1016/S0002-9610(01)00790-5\n10.1245/s10434-006-9076-y\n10.1016/S0221-0363(06)74165-8\n10.1245/s10434-009-0388-6\n10.1186/1471-2407-11-444\n10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2018.02.009\n10.1109/TUFFC.2014.2991\n10.1007/s10549-019-05476-6\n10.3892/mco.2016.948\n10.4048/jbc.2019.22.e58\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2010.09.031\n10.1016/j.ejso.2014.01.002\n10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.07.004\n10.1007/s12282-015-0628-5\n10.1245/s10434-019-07226-w\n10.1007/s10549-018-4951-3\n10.1259/bjr.20150581\n10.1016/j.jss.2019.03.029\n10.1016/j.amjsurg.2015.08.028\n10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2019.12.004\n10.1016/j.aorn.2013.09.002\n10.1111/tbj.12796\n10.1593/neo.81328\n10.1002/jso.24246\n10.1245/s10434-014-3602-0\n10.1155/2012/868623\n10.1186/s40064-015-0801-5\n10.1007/s10549-020-05773-5\n10.1016/j.ejso.2016.07.141\n10.1016/j.acra.2017.09.018\n10.1016/j.compmedimag.2018.06.002\n10.1016/j.acra.2019.06.018\n10.1002/jbio.201800255\n10.1364/BOE.7.004139\n10.1126/sciadv.1602168\n10.1073/pnas.1416955111\n10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2020.106475\n10.1038/s41598-017-13237-y\n10.1364/BOE.10.004496\n10.1038/labinvest.2015.158\n10.18632/oncotarget.8282\n10.1126/science.2470152\n10.2967/jnumed.116.181032\n10.1371/journal.pone.0234791\n10.1007/s11307-019-01462-y\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0417\n10.1038/srep12080\n10.1002/anie.202013265\n10.1007/s10549-018-4845-4"}
{"title": "Ultrafast Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI of the Breast: How Is It Used?", "abstract": "Ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced (UF-DCE) MRI is a new approach to capture kinetic information in the very early post-contrast period with high temporal resolution while keeping reasonable spatial resolution. The detailed timing and shape of the upslope in the time-intensity curve are analyzed. New kinetic parameters obtained from UF-DCE MRI are useful in differentiating malignant from benign lesions and in evaluating prognostic markers of the breast cancers. Clinically, UF-DCE MRI contributes in identifying hypervascular lesions when the background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) is marked on conventional dynamic MRI. This review starts with the technical aspect of accelerated acquisition. Practical aspects of UF-DCE MRI include identification of target hypervascular lesions from marked BPE and diagnosis of malignant and benign lesions based on new kinetic parameters derived from UF-DCE MRI: maximum slope (MS), time to enhance (TTE), bolus arrival time (BAT), time interval between arterial and venous visualization (AVI), and empirical mathematical model (EMM). The parameters derived from UF-DCE MRI are compared in terms of their diagnostic performance and association with prognostic markers. Pitfalls of UF-DCE MRI in the clinical situation are also covered. Since UF-DCE MRI is an evolving technique, future prospects of UF-DCE MRI are discussed in detail by citing recent evidence. The topic covers prediction of treatment response, multiparametric approach using DWI-derived parameters, evaluation of tumor-related vessels, and application of artificial intelligence for UF-DCE MRI.

Recently, scaffold-based three-dimensional (3D) models have been developed for anti-cancer drug research. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-proliferative effects of Astragalus hamosus (A. hamosus) in 3D fibrin gel against MCF-7 cell line. We have also evaluated anti-proliferative effect of A. hamosus differences between 3D and 2D cultures.\nThe fibrin gel formulation was first optimized by testing the structural and mechanical properties. Then the cytotoxic effect of A. hamosus extract was assessed on MCF-7 cells by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL method and flow cytometry. Cell cycle and proliferation were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis-related gene expression such as Bcl-2, caspase-3, -8 and -9 were quantified by real time-PCR.\nTUNEL staining showed a significant damage accompanied with cell apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that apoptosis increased after treatment with A. hamosus extract in 3D culture model compared to 2D culture. The A. hamosus extract arrested cell cycle in the S and G2/M phases in 3D model while in the 2D culture G0/G1 phase was affected. Treatment with A. hamosus extract led to upregulation of the caspase-3, -8 and -9 genes and downregulation of the Ki-67 in the 3D-culture compared with the 2D culture.\nThese results indicated that A. hamosus extract could be used as a therapeutic candidate for BC due to its anti-proliferative effects. Furthermore, 3D fibrin gel could be better than 2D-cultured cells in simulating important tumor characteristics in vivo, namely, anti-proliferative and anti-apoptotic features.", "journal": "Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP", "date": "2022-03-01", "authors": ["MozaffarMahmoodi", "SomayehEbrahimi-Barough", "ShaghayeghKamian", "MahmoudAzami", "MozhganMehri", "MohammadAbdi", "JafarAi"], "doi": "10.31557/APJCP.2022.23.2.731"}
{"title": "Four-quadrant fast compressive tracking of breast ultrasound videos for computer-aided response evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in mice.", "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a valuable treatment approach for locally advanced breast cancer. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) potentially enables the assessment of therapeutic response to NAC. In order to evaluate the response accurately, quantitatively and objectively, a method that can effectively compensate motions of breast cancer in CEUS videos is urgently needed.\nWe proposed the four-quadrant fast compressive tracking (FQFCT) approach to automatically perform CEUS video tracking and compensation for mice undergoing NAC. The FQFCT divided a tracking window into four smaller windows at four quadrants of a breast lesion and formulated the tracking at each quadrant as a binary classification task. After the FQFCT of breast cancer videos, the quantitative features of CEUS including the mean transit time (MTT) were computed. All mice showed a pathological response to NAC. The features between pre- (day 1) and post-treatment (day 3 and day 5) in these responders were statistically compared.\nWhen we tracked the CEUS videos of mice with the FQFCT, the average tracking error of FQFCT was 0.65\u00a0mm, reduced by 46.72% compared with the classic fast compressive tracking method (1.22\u00a0mm). After compensation with the FQFCT, the MTT on day 5 of the NAC was significantly different from the MTT before NAC (day 1) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013).\nThe FQFCT improves the accuracy of CEUS video tracking and contributes to the computer-aided response evaluation of NAC for breast cancer in mice.", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "date": "2022-02-27", "authors": ["YifeiYan", "LeiTang", "HaiboHuang", "QihuiYu", "HaohaoXu", "YingChen", "ManChen", "QiZhang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106698"}

{"title": "Implementation of volumetric-modulated arc therapy for locally advanced breast cancer patients: Dosimetric comparison with deliverability consideration of planning techniques and predictions of patient-specific QA results via supervised machine learning.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to implement a clinically deliverable VMAT planning technique dedicated to advanced breast cancer, and to predict failed QA using a machine learning (ML) model to optimize the QA workload.\nFor three planning methods (2A: 2-partial arc, 2AS: 2-partial arc with splitting, 4A: 4-partial arc), dosimetric results were compared with patient-specific QA performed with the electronic portal imaging device of the linac. A dataset was built with the pass/fail status of the plans and complexity metrics. It was divided into training and testing sets. An ML metamodel combining predictions from six base classifiers was trained on the training set to predict plans as 'pass' or 'fail'. The predictive performances were evaluated using the unseen data of the testing set.\nThe dosimetric comparison highlighted that 4A was the highest dosimetric performant method but also the poorest performant in the QA process. 2AS spared the best heart, but provided the highest dose to the contralateral breast and lowest node coverage. 2A provides a dosimetric compromise between organ at risk sparing and PTV coverage with satisfactory QA results. The metamodel had a median predictive sensitivity of 73% and a median specificity of 91%.\nThe 2A method was selected to calculate clinically deliverable VMAT plans; however, the 2AS method was maintained when the heart was of particular importance and breath-hold techniques were not applicable.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the frequency and proportions of extracted variables, and narrative syntheses was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the different screening modalities. The mixed methods appraisal tool was used to assess the quality of studies included in the review.\nFifteen studies were included, which consisted of 72,572 women in ten countries in SSA. 63% (8/15) of the included publications evaluated Clinical Breast Examination (CBE), 47% (7/15) evaluated mammography and 7% (1/15) evaluated ultrasound screening. The cancer detection rate was\u2009<\u20091/1000 to 3.3/1000 and 3.3/100 to 56/1000 for CBE and mammography screening respectively. There was a lot of heterogeneity in CBE methods, target age for screening and no clear documentation of screening interval. Cost-effective analyses showed that CBE screening linked to comprehensive cancer care is most cost effective. There was limited discussion of the ethics of screening, including the possible harms of screening in the absence of linkage to care. The gap between conducting good screening program and the appropriate follow-up with diagnosis and treatment remains one of the major challenges of screening in SSA.\nThere is insufficient real-world data to support the systematic implementation of national breast cancer screening in SSA.

{"title": "SuPART: supervised projective adapted resonance theory for automatic quality assurance approval of radiotherapy treatment plans.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy is a common treatment modality for the treatment of cancer, where treatments must be carefully designed to deliver appropriate dose to targets while avoiding healthy organs. The comprehensive multi-disciplinary quality assurance (QA) process in radiotherapy is designed to ensure safe and effective treatment plans are delivered to patients. However, the plan QA process is expensive, often time-intensive, and requires review of large quantities of complex data, potentially leading to human error in QA assessment. We therefore develop an automated machine learning algorithm to identify 'acceptable' plans (plans that are similar to historically approved plans) and 'unacceptable' plans (plans that are dissimilar to historically approved plans). This algorithm is a supervised extension of projective adaptive resonance theory, called SuPART, that learns a set of distinctive features, and considers deviations from them indications of unacceptable plans. We test SuPART on breast and prostate radiotherapy datasets from our institution, and find that SuPART outperforms common classification algorithms in several measures of accuracy. When no falsely approved plans are allowed, SuPART can correctly auto-approve 34% of the acceptable breast and 32% of the acceptable prostate plans, and can also correctly reject 53% of the unacceptable breast and 56% of the unacceptable prostate plans. Thus, usage of SuPART to aid in QA could potentially yield significant time savings.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2022-02-19", "authors": ["HootanKamran", "Dionne MAleman", "ChrisMcIntosh", "Thomas GPurdie"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/ac568f"}

However, in practice, diagnoses are made using multiple imaging modalities alongside other data sources. We determined the importance of this multi-modal information and compared the diagnostic performance of routine breast cancer diagnosis to breast ultrasound interpretations by humans or AI-based algorithms.\nPatients were recruited as part of a multicenter trial (NCT02638935). The trial enrolled 1288 women undergoing routine breast cancer diagnosis (multi-modal imaging, demographic, and clinical information). Three physicians specialized in ultrasound diagnosis performed a second read of all ultrasound images. We used data from 11 of 12 study sites to develop two machine learning (ML) algorithms using unimodal information (ultrasound features generated by the ultrasound experts) to classify breast masses which were validated on the remaining study site. The same ML algorithms were subsequently developed and validated on multi-modal information (clinical and demographic information plus ultrasound features). We assessed performance using area under the curve (AUC).\nOf 1288 breast masses, 368 (28.6%) were histopathologically malignant. In the external validation set (n\u2009=\u2009373), the performance of the two unimodal ultrasound ML algorithms (AUC 0.83 and 0.82) was commensurate with performance of the human ultrasound experts (AUC 0.82 to 0.84; p for all comparisons\u2009>\u20090.05).

Treatment for early-stage breast cancer is highly cost effective. Five-year survival rate for stage 0-2 breast cancer exceeds 90%. Screening mammography has been acknowledged as the most reliable way to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. Taiwan government has been urging women without any symptoms, aged between 45 and 69, to have a screening mammogram bi-yearly. This brings about a large workload for radiologists. In light of this, this paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)-based model as an efficient and reliable tool to assist radiologists with mammographic interpretation. For the first time in the literature, mammograms are completely classified into BI-RADS categories 0, 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 4C and 5. The proposed model was trained using block-based images segmented from a mammogram dataset of our own. A block-based image was applied to the model as an input, and a BI-RADS category was predicted as an output. At the end of this paper, the outperformance of this work is demonstrated by an overall accuracy of 94.22%, an average sensitivity of 95.31%, an average specificity of 99.15% and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.9723.

Surgery and adjuvant therapy, coupled with early detection, could save many lives. This underscores the importance of mammography, a cost-effective and accurate method for early detection.

However, its clinical adoption is slow due to the limited number of clinical evaluation studies and because often, the translation of the predicted dose distribution to a deliverable plan is lacking. This study evaluates two different, deliverable AI plans in terms of their clinical acceptability based on quantitative parameters and qualitative evaluation by four radiation oncologists.\nFor 20 left-sided node-negative breast cancer patients, treated with a prescribed dose of 40.05\u00a0Gy, using tangential beam intensity modulated radiotherapy, two model-based treatment plans were evaluated against the corresponding manual plan. The two models used were an in-house developed U-net model and a vendor-developed contextual atlas regression forest model (cARF). Radiation oncologists evaluated the clinical acceptability of each blinded plan and ranked plans according to preference. Furthermore, a comparison with the manual plan was made based on dose volume histogram parameters, clinical evaluation criteria and preparation time.\nThe U-net model resulted in a higher average and maximum dose to the PTV (median difference 0.37\u00a0Gy and 0.47\u00a0Gy respectively) and a slightly higher mean heart dose (MHD) (0.01\u00a0Gy). The cARF model led to higher average and maximum doses to the PTV (0.30 and 0.39\u00a0Gy respectively) and a slightly higher MHD (0.02\u00a0Gy) and mean lung dose (MLD, 0.04\u00a0Gy). The maximum MHD/MLD difference was\u2009\u2264\u20090.5\u00a0Gy for both AI plans. Regardless of these dose differences, 90-95% of the AI plans were considered clinically acceptable versus 90% of the manual plans. Preferences varied between the radiation oncologists. Plan preparation time was comparable between the U-net model and the manual plan (287\u00a0s vs 253\u00a0s) while the cARF model took longer (471\u00a0s). When only considering user interaction, plan generation time was 121\u00a0s for the cARF model and 137\u00a0s for the U-net model.\nTwo AI models were used to generate deliverable plans for breast cancer patients, in a time-efficient manner, requiring minimal user interaction.

{"title": "Breast lesions classifications of mammographic images using a deep convolutional neural network-based approach.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the worst illnesses, with a higher fatality rate among women globally. Breast cancer detection needs accurate mammography interpretation and analysis, which is challenging for radiologists owing to the intricate anatomy of the breast and low image quality. Advances in deep learning-based models have significantly improved breast lesions' detection, localization, risk assessment, and categorization. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based convolutional neural network (ConvNet) that significantly reduces human error in diagnosing breast malignancy tissues. Our methodology is most effective in eliciting task-specific features, as feature learning is coupled with classification tasks to achieve higher performance in automatically classifying the suspicious regions in mammograms as benign and malignant. To evaluate the model's validity, 322 raw mammogram images from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) and 580 from Private datasets were obtained to extract in-depth features, the intensity of information, and the high likelihood of malignancy. Both datasets are magnificently improved through preprocessing, synthetic data augmentation, and transfer learning techniques to attain the distinctive combination of breast tumors. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed approach achieved remarkable training accuracy of 0.98, test accuracy of 0.97, high sensitivity of 0.99, and an AUC of 0.99 in classifying breast masses on mammograms.

{"title": "FOXM1 mediates GDF-15 dependent stemness and intrinsic drug resistance in breast cancer.", "abstract": "Stemness, a key component of breast cancer (BC) heterogeneity, is responsible for chemoresistance. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) induces drug resistance and stemness in BC cells. In this study, the expressions and interactions of GDF-15, FOXM1, and stemness (OCT4 and SOX2), and drug resistance (ABCC5) markers were evaluated in BC.\n40 diagnosed BC patients and 40 healthy controls were included in this study. Serum GDF-15 was significantly raised (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in BC patients. Expressions of GDF-15, OCT4, SOX2, and FOXM1 in BC tissue and cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were determined by RT-PCR, while phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) was analyzed by Western blot. Not only were the fold change expressions higher in cancer tissue as compared to surrounding control tissue, but a higher expression was observed for all the genes along with p-AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to MCF-7. Tissue GDF-15 was significantly associated with ABCC5 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), OCT4 (p\u2009=\u20090.002), SOX2 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and FOXM1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). To further analyze the signaling pathway involved in stemness and drug resistance in BC, GDF-15 knockdown was performed, which reduced the expression of p-AKT, FOXM1, OCT4 and SOX2, and ABCC5, whereas recombinant GDF-15 treatment reversed the same.

However, AIs reduce bone density and increase bone-related events (BREs). Alongside calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation, bisphosphonates and denosumab are well-known options for improving outcomes in bone health and breast cancer prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the practice patterns of bone health guideline-based management in real-world patients with ER\u00a0+\u00a0eBC.\nIn total, 68 patients with ER\u00a0+\u00a0eBC treated between 2009 and 2014 at the University Hospital Basel were included in this retrospective cohort study. Chart reviews were analyzed. Baseline, clinicopathological, treatment, and BRE data were extracted. Each patient was specifically reviewed for therapy adherence to the Swiss bone health guidelines (Swiss Association against Osteoporosis 2010 [SVGO]).\nThe mean patient age was 66.5 (range, 56-74) years, all post-menopausal. The most frequent tumor characteristics were tumor size of pT1-pT2 (N\u00a0=\u00a053, 77.9%) and treatment with letrozole (N\u00a0=\u00a035, 51.5%), followed by tamoxifen as a switch strategy (N\u00a0=\u00a027, 40.3%).

{"title": "Data Driven for Early Breast Cancer Staging using Integrated Mammography and Biopsy.", "abstract": "Breast cancer patients who have a rapid diagnosis have been better prognosis than late diagnosis. The popular screening is mammogram or ultrasound. In recent years, researchers try to develop data driven models to predict early cancer staging from the first screening. However, data elements are not complete such as lymph node status. Therefore, the Integrated dataset approach will be challenging.\nBecause the data elements are not collected from the same source, joining between mammography and biopsy data were performed using latent variables that determine by tumor severity. The datasets consist of 445 mammography reports and 183 pathological reports. The latent variables of the mammogram dataset were determined by the severity of mass, while latent variables of the pathological dataset were determined by TNM Staging. The latent variables were used to join between two datasets. Then, the prediction models were built using the machine learning technique. The modeling is divided into three steps; staging prediction, lymph node prediction, and prognosis.\nIntegrated dataset from mammography and biopsy extend more factors and built the models to predict breast cancer staging in the mammography process. The staging prediction is 100% accuracy. The lymph node prediction are 72.47% accuracy, 73.94% specificity, and 72.5% sensitivity. An area under ROC curve is 0.74. The prognosis model prediction are 72.72% accuracy, 80% specificity, and 77% sensitivity. An area under ROC curve is 0.87. There are also built the rule for early staging, diagnosis, and prognosis. \u00a0Conclusion: This study aims to build the models for early staging, diagnosis, and prognosis using the less aggressive method. The advantages are (1) predict staging from the first screening (2) estimate the lymph node metastases for planning to ALND or SLNB (3) evaluate overall survival time. These advantages help the physician planning the best treatment for cancer patients.", "journal": "Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP", "date": "2021-12-31", "authors": ["TongjaiYampaka", "DuangjaiNoolek"], "doi": "10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.12.4069"}
{"title": "Co-treatment with miR-21-5p inhibitor and Aurora kinase inhibitor reversine suppresses breast cancer progression by targeting sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 2.", "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported the regulatory effects of miR-21-5p and reversine in human breast cancer (HBC). However, the mechanism of reversine and miR-21-5p has not been fully investigated in HBC. The aim of the current study was to assess the mechanism of action of reversine, with or without miR-21-5p, in HBC progression. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot results confirmed the upregulation of miR-21-5p and downregulation of sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 2 (SPRY2) in HBC. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay identified the correlation between miR-21-5p and SPRY2. Cell function experiment results indicated a decrease in migration, proliferation, and invasion of HBC cells treated with miR-21-5p inhibitor and reversine; however, an increase in apoptosis was observed in these cells. Apoptotic ability was more enhanced and migration, proliferation, and invasion were more impaired in HBC cells treated with both miR-21-5p inhibitor and reversine than in those treated individually with either inhibitors. SPRY2, downstream of miR-21-5p, participated in HBC progression with reversine. Overall, our study proved that combining the miR-21-5p inhibitor with reversine produced a synergistic effect by regulating SPRY2, thereby limiting HBC progression.

{"title": "Radiotherapy Standardisation and Artificial Intelligence within the National Cancer Institute's Clinical Trials Network.", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence in healthcare refers to the use of complex algorithms designed to conduct certain tasks in an automated manner. Artificial intelligence has a transformative power in radiation oncology to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care, given the increase in volume and complexity of digital data, as well as the multi-faceted and highly technical nature of this field of medicine. However, artificial intelligence alone will not be able to fix healthcare's problem, because new technologies bring unexpected and potentially underappreciated obstacles. The inclusion of multicentre datasets, the incorporation of time-varying data, the assessment of missing data as well as informative censoring and the addition of clinical utility could significantly improve artificial intelligence models. Standardisation plays a crucial, supportive and leading role in artificial intelligence. Clinical trials are the most reliable method of demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a treatment or clinical approach, as well as providing high-level evidence to justify artificial intelligence. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the Gynecologic Oncology Group collaborated to form NRG Oncology (acronym NRG derived from the names of the parental groups). NRG Oncology is one of the adult cancer clinical trial groups containing radiotherapy specialty of the National Cancer Institute's Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Standardisation from NRG/NCTN has the potential to reduce variation in clinical treatment and patient outcome by eliminating potential errors, enabling broader application of artificial intelligence tools. NCTN, NRG and Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core are in a unique position to help with standards development, advocacy and enforcement, all of which can benefit from artificial intelligence, as artificial intelligence has the ability to improve trial success rates by transforming crucial phases in clinical trial design, from study planning through to execution. Here we will examine: (i) how to conduct technical and clinical evaluations before adopting artificial intelligence technologies, (ii) how to obtain high-quality data for artificial intelligence, (iii) the NCTN infrastructure and standards, (iv) radiotherapy standardisation for clinical trials and (v) artificial intelligence applications in standardisation.", "journal": "Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain))", "date": "2021-12-16", "authors": ["S HLee", "HGeng", "YXiao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clon.2021.11.020\n10.1001/JAMA.2020.8737\n10.1016/J.RADONC.2020.09.008\n10.1377/hblog20180917.283077/full/\n10.1259/BJR.20190001\n10.1001/JAMAINTERNMED.2016.8021\n10.1016/J.JAMDA.2017.03.018\n10.1056/NEJMC2104626/SUPPL_FILE/NEJMC2104626_DISCLOSURES.PDF\n10.1016/J.IJMEDINF.2017.01.015\n10.1001/JAMA.2019.21579\n10.1093/jnci/djt001\n10.1016/J.ACRA.2011.10.008\n10.21037/TLCR.2017.09.06\n10.1002/MP.12873\n10.1016/J.IJROBP.2017.12.013\n10.1016/S0167-8140(21)01312-8\n10.1016/J.IJROBP.2019.01.087\n10.1148/RADIOL.2020191145\n10.1016/J.IJROBP.2018.05.053\n10.18383/J.TOM.2019.00030\n10.1016/J.RADONC.2018.10.027\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141\n10.1016/j.adro.2020.05.005\n10.1016/J.IJROBP.2020.07.822\n10.3389/fonc.2020.00986\n10.1186/s13014-016-0640-8"}

However, the contouring task is difficult because of the poorer contrast of breast gland in planning CT. To improve its efficiency and accuracy, prior information was introduced in a 3D U-Net model to predict the contour of breast gland automatically.\nThe preoperative CT was first aligned to the planning CT via affine registration. The resulting transform was then applied to the contour of breast gland in preoperative CT, and the corresponding contour in planning CT was obtained. This transformed contour was a preliminary estimation of breast gland in planning CT and was used as prior information in a 3D U-Net model to obtain a more accurate contour. For evaluation, the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to assess the deep learning (DL) model's prediction accuracy.\nThe average DSC and HD of the prediction model were 0.775\u00b10.065 and 44.979\u00b120.565 for breast gland without the input of prior information, while the average values were 0.830\u00b10.038 and 17.896\u00b15.737 with the input of prior information (0.775 \nThe prediction accuracy was increased significantly with the introduction of prior information, which provided valuable geometrical distribution of target for model training.

From each tumor, we extracted eight perfusion parameters using the maximum slope algorithm and 36 texture parameters using the filtered histogram technique. Relationships between CT parameters and histological factors were analyzed using five machine learning algorithms. Performance was compared using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) with the DeLong test. The AUCs of the machine learning models increased when using both features instead of the perfusion or texture features alone. The random forest model that integrated texture and perfusion features was the best model for prediction (AUC = 0.76). In the integrated random forest model, the AUCs for predicting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity, estrogen receptor positivity, progesterone receptor positivity, ki67 positivity, high tumor grade, and molecular subtype were 0.86, 0.76, 0.69, 0.65, 0.75, and 0.79, respectively. Entropy of pre- and postcontrast images and perfusion, time to peak, and peak enhancement intensity of hot spots are the five most important CT parameters for prediction.

Indeed, breast cancer multiparametric studies can highlight not only qualitative imaging parameters, as the presence/absence of a likely malignant finding, but also quantitative parameters, suggesting clinical-pathological features through the evaluation of imaging biomarkers. A further step has been the introduction of artificial intelligence and in particular radiogenomics, that investigates the relationship between breast cancer imaging characteristics and tumor molecular, genomic and proliferation features.

{"title": "Understanding machine learning classifier decisions in automated radiotherapy quality assurance.", "abstract": "The complexity of generating radiotherapy treatments demands a rigorous quality assurance (QA) process to ensure patient safety and to avoid clinically significant errors. Machine learning classifiers have been explored to augment the scope and efficiency of the traditional radiotherapy treatment planning QA process. However, one important gap in relying on classifiers for QA of radiotherapy treatment plans is the lack of understanding behind a specific classifier prediction. We develop explanation methods to understand the decisions of two automated QA classifiers: (1) a region of interest (ROI) segmentation/labeling classifier, and (2) a treatment plan acceptance classifier. For each classifier, a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) framework and a novel adaption of team-based Shapley values framework are constructed. We test these methods in datasets for two radiotherapy treatment sites (prostate and breast), and demonstrate the importance of evaluating QA classifiers using interpretable machine learning approaches. We additionally develop a notion of explanation consistency to assess classifier performance. Our explanation method allows for easy visualization and human expert assessment of classifier decisions in radiotherapy QA. Notably, we find that our team-based Shapley approach is more consistent than LIME. The ability to explain and validate automated decision-making is critical in medical treatments. This analysis allows us to conclude that both QA classifiers are moderately trustworthy and can be used to confirm expert decisions, though the current QA classifiers should not be viewed as a replacement for the human QA process.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2021-11-30", "authors": ["YunshengChen", "Dionne MAleman", "Thomas GPurdie", "ChrisMcIntosh"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/ac3e0e"}

Likewise, a broad spectrum of imaging ligands has been introduced for noninvasive positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging to enable comprehensive tumor characterization and more accurate response evaluation.\nIn recent years, novel radioactively labeled ligands have been developed for PET/CT imaging in metastatic breast cancer. One promising tracer is [18F]fluoroestradiol, which was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It can be used for a whole-body assessment of estrogen receptor status. Another radionuclide currently under development is [68Ga]Ga-fibroblast-activation-protein inhibitor. In addition to new radionuclides, the field of application for existing tracers like [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was broadened. It has been shown that an early therapeutic response to various therapies can be detected by [18F]FDG PET/CT, which leads to early treatment optimization.

It can require additional investigations, treatment, and interruption of cancer therapy. It is important for clinicians to have an awareness of its incidence and severity, however real-world data are lacking and do not always correlate with findings from clinical trials. Similarly, there is a dearth of information on cost impact of symptomatic pneumonitis. Informatics approaches are increasingly being applied to healthcare data for their ability to identify specific patient cohorts efficiently, at scale. We developed a Structured Query Language (SQL)-based informatics algorithm which we applied to CT report text to identify cases of ICI and radiotherapy pneumonitis between 1/1/2015 and 31/12/2020. Further data on severity, investigations, medical management were also acquired from the electronic health record. We identified 248 cases of pneumonitis attributable to ICI and/or radiotherapy, of which 139 were symptomatic with CTCAE severity grade 2 or more. The grade \u22652 ICI pneumonitis incidence in our cohort is 5.43%, greater than the all-grade 1.3-2.7% incidence reported in the literature.

The use of image processing methods and pattern recognition techniques in automatic breast detection from mammographic images decreases human errors and increments the rapidity of diagnosis. In this paper, mammographic images are analyzed using image processing techniques and a pipeline structure for the diagnosis of the cancerous masses. In the first stage, the quality of mammogram images and the contrast of abnormal areas in the image are improved by using image contrast improvement and a noise decline. A method based on color space is then used for image segmentation that is followed by mathematical morphology. Then, for feature image extraction, a combined gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is used. At last, a new optimized version of convolutional neural network (CNN) and a new improved metaheuristic, called Advanced Thermal Exchange Optimizer, are used for the classification of the features. A comparison of the simulations of the proposed technique with three different techniques from the literature applied on the MIAS mammogram database is performed to show its superiority.

Those with autologous, tissue expander/implant, and single-stage direct-to-implant reconstruction were included. Postmastectomy radiation therapy was delivered either with three-dimensional conformal photon or proton therapy. Complication endpoints were defined based on surgical reintervention operative notes as infection/necrosis requiring d\u00e9bridement. For implant-based patients, complications were defined as capsular contracture requiring capsulotomy and implant failure. For each complication endpoint, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-penalized regression was used to select the subset of predictors associated with the smallest prediction error from 10-fold cross-validation. Nomograms were built using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-selected predictors, and internal validation using cross-validation was performed.\nMedian follow-up was 6.6 years. Among 1617 patients, 23 percent underwent autologous reconstruction, 39 percent underwent direct-to-implant reconstruction, and 37 percent underwent tissue expander/implant reconstruction. Among 759 patients who received postmastectomy radiation therapy, 8.3 percent received proton-therapy to the chest wall and nodes and 43 percent received chest wall boost. Internal validation for each model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 73 percent for infection, 75 percent for capsular contracture, 76 percent for absolute implant failure, and 68 percent for overall implant failure. Periareolar incisions and complete implant muscle coverage were found to be important predictors for infection and capsular contracture, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, we found that protons compared to no postmastectomy radiation therapy significantly increased capsular contracture risk (OR, 15.3; p < 0.001).

Recent development in artificial intelligence has promoted radiomics studies in various fields including breast cancer treatment and numerous studies have been conducted. However, radiomics has shown a translational gap in clinical practice, and many issues remain to be solved. In this review, we will outline the steps of radiomics workflow and investigate clinical application of radiomics focusing on breast MRI based on published literature, as well as current discussion about limitations and challenges in radiomics.", "journal": "La Radiologia medica", "date": "2021-10-28", "authors": ["HirokoSatake", "SatokoIshigaki", "RintaroIto", "ShinjiNaganawa"], "doi": "10.1007/s11547-021-01423-y\n10.1148/rg.2020200006\n10.1007/s11604-021-01110-y\n10.1007/s11604-020-01049-6\n10.1148/radiol.2019182947\n10.1002/jmri.27332\n10.1056/NEJMp1500523\n10.1007/s11547-021-01389-x\n10.1007/s00330-021-08056-9\n10.1002/jmri.26852\n10.1148/radiol.2018181352\n10.3389/fonc.2021.633176\n10.1007/s00330-017-4859-z\n10.3348/kjr.2019.0855\n10.1080/0284186X.2018.1445283\n10.1007/s12194-017-0433-2\n10.3109/0284186X.2013.812798\n10.1118/1.4955435\n10.1016/j.mri.2012.06.010\n10.1109/TMI.2018.2857800\n10.1088/1361-6560/ab0b64\n10.1002/mp.12079\n10.1117/1.JMI.5.1.014502\n10.1177/1533033820916191\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2016.09.005\n10.1007/s11547-021-01405-0\n10.1002/jmri.26556\n10.1007/s11604-020-01057-6\n10.1259/bjr.20190948\n10.1148/radiol.2015151169\n10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.04.002\n10.1002/mp.13678\n10.11323/jjmp.38.3_129\n10.1186/s41747-018-0068-z\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960229)15:4<361::AID-SIM168>3.0.CO;2-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0137036\n10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30058-5\n10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.02.006\n10.1002/mrm.10496\n10.1016/j.mri.2013.12.002\n10.1016/j.acra.2009.08.012\n10.1016/j.acra.2009.01.029\n10.1016/j.acra.2008.06.005\n10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.10.007\n10.1007/s13246-020-00852-9\n10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.04.06\n10.1002/jmri.25606\n10.1002/jmri.25873\n10.1007/s10549-020-05533-5\n10.1117/1.JMI.7.4.044502\n10.3892/ol.2018.8805\n10.1186/1471-2407-14-366\n10.1002/jmri.27098\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000656\n10.1186/s12880-021-00571-x\n10.1186/s41747-019-0131-4\n10.1002/jmri.26732\n10.1007/s00330-020-06991-7\n10.1002/mp.12453\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000544\n10.1002/jmri.26981\n10.1007/s11604-021-01098-5\n10.1148/radiol.2020200292\n10.1007/s00330-021-07787-z\n10.1007/s00330-015-3845-6\n10.1186/s12880-017-0239-z\n10.1371/journal.pone.0171683\n10.1155/2018/5076269\n10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.11.024\n10.1186/s12885-020-07557-y\n10.1007/s11307-019-01383-w\n10.1016/j.acra.2020.05.040\n10.1371/journal.pone.0234871\n10.3390/jcm9061853\n10.1007/s11547-019-01100-1\n10.1016/j.acra.2021.02.001\n10.1016/j.acra.2020.02.006\n10.1016/j.acra.2018.01.006\n10.1002/jmri.27651\n10.1007/s00330-018-5891-3\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.2561\n10.1371/journal.pone.0143308\n10.1016/j.acra.2021.02.008\n10.1002/jmri.26224\n10.3389/fonc.2020.541849\n10.1007/s00330-017-5005-7\n10.1002/jmri.26701\n10.1007/s00330-020-07674-z\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.28086\n10.1016/j.acra.2019.11.004\n10.1007/s00330-018-5981-2\n10.18383/j.tom.2018.00046\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000518\n10.1148/radiol.14130569\n10.1002/jmri.25279\n10.18383/j.tom.2016.00241\n10.1136/amiajnl-2012-001460\n10.1186/s13058-017-0846-1\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.06.019\n10.1118/1.4933198\n10.1002/jmri.25276\n10.1007/s00330-017-4850-8\n10.1148/radiol.2017170143\n10.1111/tbj.13032\n10.1259/bjr.20200287\n10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100831\n10.1007/s12094-019-02109-8\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3190\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2019.108736\n10.1007/s10278-018-0144-1\n10.1111/1759-7714.13309\n10.1148/radiol.2016160261\n10.1007/s00330-021-07816-x\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3783\n10.1038/s41598-020-60822-9\n10.1038/s41598-020-59923-2\n10.3390/curroncol28040217\n10.1148/radiol.2018172361\n10.1016/j.radonc.2017.10.023\n10.1259/bjr.20190271\n10.1007/s00330-020-06957-9\n10.1148/radiol.2020191145\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141\n10.1007/s00432-021-03606-6\n10.1007/s00330-019-06360-z\n10.1148/radiol.2018172171"}

{"title": "Classification and Visualization of Chemotherapy-Induced Cognitive Impairment in Volumetric Convolutional Neural Networks.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common female cancer worldwide, and breast cancer accounts for 30% of female cancers. Of all the treatment modalities, breast cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy might complain about cognitive impairment during and after cancer treatment. This phenomenon, chemo-brain, is used to describe the alterations in cognitive functions after receiving systemic chemotherapy. Few reports detect the chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) by performing functional MRI (fMRI) and a deep learning analysis. In this study, we recruited 55 postchemotherapy breast cancer survivors (C+ group) and 65 healthy controls (HC group) and extracted mean fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (mfALFF) from resting-state fMRI as our input feature. Two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121, were transformed to 3D, embedded with squeeze and excitation (SE) blocks and then trained to differentiate cerebral alterations based on the effect of chemotherapy. An integrated gradient was applied to visualize the pattern that was recognized by our model. The average performance of SE-ResNet-50 models was an accuracy of 80%, precision of 78% and recall of 70%; on the other hand, the SE-DenseNet-121 model reached identical results with an average of 80% accuracy, 86% precision and 80% recall. The regions with the greatest contributions highlighted by the integrated gradients algorithm for differentiating chemo-brain were the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobe. These regions were consistent with other studies and strongly associated with the default mode and dorsal attention networks. We constructed two volumetric state-of-the-art models and visualized the patterns that are critical for identifying chemo-brains from normal brains. We hope that these results will be helpful in clinically tracking chemo-brain in the future.", "journal": "Journal of personalized medicine", "date": "2021-10-24", "authors": ["Kai-YiLin", "Vincent Chin-HungChen", "Yuan-HsiungTsai", "Roger SMcIntyre", "Jun-ChengWeng"], "doi": "10.3390/jpm11101025\n10.3322/caac.21590\n10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2010.04.021\n10.1093/jncimonographs/lgv009\n10.1162/neco.1989.1.4.541\n10.1145/3065386\n10.1145/3236009\n10.1371/journal.pone.0025031\n10.1109/72.279181\n10.1371/journal.pone.0232548\n10.1016/j.tics.2013.09.012\n10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-014030\n10.1073/pnas.91.11.5033\n10.1073/pnas.98.2.676\n10.1016/j.tins.2018.03.004\n10.1073/pnas.0135058100\n10.1177/1073858411403316\n10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.38\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e31820af94e\n10.1038/srep21657\n10.1016/j.acra.2016.05.014\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.03.036\n10.1007/s00234-016-1708-8\n10.1038/srep45135\n10.1186/1471-2377-12-28\n10.1073/pnas.1214551110\n10.1038/s41598-018-36380-6\n10.1038/nrn755\n10.1177/1073858413494269\n10.1016/j.tics.2012.10.008\n10.1038/srep42684\n10.1007/s11682-013-9244-1\n10.3389/fnhum.2011.00122\n10.1080/13803390903032537"}

{"title": "Evaluation of deep learning-based autosegmentation in breast cancer radiotherapy.", "abstract": "To study the performance of a proposed deep learning-based autocontouring system in delineating organs at risk (OARs) in breast radiotherapy with a group of experts.\nEleven experts from two institutions delineated nine OARs in 10 cases of adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. Autocontours were then provided to the experts for correction. Overall, 110 manual contours, 110 corrected autocontours, and 10 autocontours of each type of OAR were analyzed. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to compare the degree of agreement between the best manual contour (chosen by an independent expert committee) and each autocontour, corrected autocontour, and manual contour. Higher DSCs and lower HDs indicated a better geometric overlap. The amount of time reduction using the autocontouring system was examined. User satisfaction was evaluated using a survey.\nManual contours, corrected autocontours, and autocontours had a similar accuracy in the average DSC value (0.88 vs. 0.90 vs. 0.90). The accuracy of autocontours ranked the second place, based on DSCs, and the first place, based on HDs among the manual contours. Interphysician variations among the experts were reduced in corrected autocontours, compared to variations in manual contours (DSC: 0.89-0.90 vs. 0.87-0.90; HD: 4.3-5.8\u00a0mm vs. 5.3-7.6\u00a0mm).

We proposed a novel 'sharp loss' function, and a parameter \u03b3 was used to adjust the loss properties. The mean square error (MSE) loss and the sharp loss with different \u03b3 values were tested and compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\nThe sharp loss achieved superior dose prediction results compared to those of the MSE loss. The best performance with the MSE loss and the sharp loss was obtained when the parameter \u03b3 was set to 100. Specifically, the mean absolute difference values for the planning target volume were 318.87\u2009\u00b1\u200930.23 for the MSE loss versus 144.15\u2009\u00b1\u200916.27 for the sharp loss with \u03b3\u2009=\u2009100 (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

{"title": "WDCCNet: Weighted Double-Classifier Constraint Neural Network for Mammographic Image Classification.", "abstract": "The early detection and timely treatment of breast cancer can save lives. Mammography is one of the most efficient approaches to screening early breast cancer. An automatic mammographic image classification method could improve the work efficiency of radiologists. Current deep learning-based methods typically use the traditional softmax loss to optimize the feature extraction part, which aims to learn the features of mammographic images. However, previous studies have shown that the feature extraction part cannot learn discriminative features from complex data using the standard softmax loss. In this paper, we design a new architecture and propose respective loss functions. Specifically, we develop a double-classifier network architecture that constrains the extracted features' distribution by changing the classifiers' decision boundaries. Then, we propose the double-classifier constraint loss function to constrain the decision boundaries so that the feature extraction part can learn discriminative features. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the architecture of two classifiers, the neural network can detect the difficult-to-classify samples. We propose a weighted double-classifier constraint method to make the feature extract part pay more attention to learning difficult-to-classify samples' features. Our proposed method can be easily applied to an existing convolutional neural network to improve mammographic image classification performance. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our methods on three public benchmark mammographic image datasets. The results showed that our methods outperformed many other similar methods and state-of-the-art methods on the three public medical benchmarks.

{"title": "Tumor-derived exosomes drive immunosuppressive macrophages in a pre-metastatic niche through glycolytic dominant metabolic reprogramming.", "abstract": "One of the defining characteristics of a pre-metastatic niche, a fundamental requirement for primary tumor metastasis, is infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophages. How these macrophages acquire their phenotype remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) polarize macrophages toward an immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased PD-L1 expression through NF-kB-dependent, glycolytic-dominant metabolic reprogramming. TDE signaling through TLR2 and NF-\u03baB leads to increased glucose uptake. TDEs also stimulate elevated NOS2, which inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation resulting in increased conversion of pyruvate to lactate.

This study aimed to develop a multimodal deep learning model that combined clinical information and pretreatment MR images for predicting pCR to NAC in patients with breast cancer. The retrospective study cohort consisted of 536 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent pre-operative NAC. We developed a deep learning model to fuse high-dimensional MR image features and the clinical information for the pretreatment prediction of pCR to NAC in breast cancer. The proposed deep learning model trained on all datasets as clinical information, T1-weighted subtraction images, and T2-weighted images shows better performance with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888 as compared to the model using only clinical information (AUC\u2009=\u20090.827, P\u2009<\u20090.05).

In addition, a second purpose is to determine the planned radiation therapy dose to cardiac structures for breast cancer therapy.\nEighteen contrast-enhanced cardiac scans acquired with a dual-layer-detector CT scanner were included for method development. Manual reference annotations of cardiac chambers, large arteries, and coronary artery locations were made in the contrast scans and transferred to virtual noncontrast images, mimicking noncontrast-enhanced CT. In addition, 31 noncontrast-enhanced radiation therapy treatment planning CTs with corresponding dose-distribution maps of breast cancer cases were included for evaluation. For reference, cardiac chambers and large vessels were manually annotated in two 2-dimensional (2D) slices per scan (26 scans, totaling 52 slices) and in 3-dimensional (3D) scan volumes in 5 scans. Coronary artery locations were annotated on 3D imaging. The method uses an ensemble of convolutional neural networks with 2 output branches that perform 2 distinct tasks: (1) segmentation of the cardiac chambers and large arteries and (2) localization of coronary arteries. Training was performed using reference annotations and virtual noncontrast cardiac scans. Automatic segmentation of the cardiac chambers and large vessels and the coronary artery locations was evaluated in radiation therapy planning CT with Dice score (DSC) and average symmetrical surface distance (ASSD). The correlation between dosimetric parameters derived from the automatic and reference segmentations was evaluated with R\nFor cardiac chambers and large arteries, median DSC was 0.76 to 0.88, and the median ASSD was 0.17 to 0.27 cm in 2D slice evaluation. 3D evaluation found a DSC of 0.87 to 0.93 and an ASSD of 0.07 to 0.10 cm.

The image/label pairs of 60 subjects were used to train a 3D deep neural network while the remaining 30 were used for testing. The rest of the 39 patients were considered out-of-distribution (\"outlier\") data, which were used to test robustness. Random rigid transformations were used to augment the dataset during training. We investigated multiple loss functions, including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), cross-entropy (CE), Euclidean loss as well as the variation and combinations of these, data augmentation, and network size on overall performance and sensitivity to image artifacts due to infrequent events such as the presence of implanted devices. The predicted label maps were compared to the ground-truth labels via DSC and mean and 90th percentile symmetric surface distance (90th-SSD).\nWhen modified Dice combined with cross-entropy (MD-CE) was used as the loss function, the algorithm achieved a mean DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 for chambers and \u00a00.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 for smaller substructures (valves and LAD).

Models with MD-CE, Dice-CE, MD, and weighted CE loss had highest performance, and were statistically similar. Data augmentation did not affect model performances on both clean and outlier data and model robustness was susceptible to network size. For a certain type of outlier data, robustness can be improved via incorporating them into the training process. The execution time for segmenting each patient was on an average 2.1\u00a0s.\nA deep neural network provides a fast and accurate segmentation of large cardiac substructures in noncontrast CT images.

The aim of this review is to discuss the recent literature on the field in order to infer a rational combination strategy including cyclin-D1/CDK4-CDK6 inhibitors, RT, and/or other anticancer agents targeting G1-S phase cell cycle transition.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2021-08-28", "authors": ["ValerioNardone", "MarcellaBarbarino", "AntonioAngrisani", "PierpaoloCorreale", "PierpaoloPastina", "SalvatoreCappabianca", "AlfonsoReginelli", "LucianoMutti", "CleliaMiracco", "RoccoGiannicola", "AntonioGiordano", "LuigiPirtoli"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms22168391\n10.1002/stem.318\n10.1038/cddiscovery.2017.33\n10.21037/tcr.2019.07.04\n10.21037/gs.2019.04.04\n10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00301-5\n10.1002/hep.29781\n10.1016/j.ctrv.2016.03.002\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00666\n10.1615/CritRevEukarGeneExpr.v5.i2.20\n10.1038/s41388-019-0980-6\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.05.025\n10.1016/s1470-2045(15)00613-0\n10.1038/nrd4504\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1675\n10.1093/annonc/mdz215\n10.1007/s00109-016-1475-3\n10.1096/fasebj.10.2.8641557\n10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0509\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.09.015\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.09.016\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2473\n10.1126/science.7652577\n10.1186/s13046-018-0873-5\n10.1093/jnci/84.22.1736\n10.2174/1568009617666170330120452\n10.2307/3572025\n10.1083/jcb.60.2.356\n10.1093/mutage/12.4.271\n10.1038/s41392-018-0018-5\n10.1186/s13046-020-01693-w\n10.3892/ijo.2018.4424\n10.3389/fonc.2018.00303\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.07.192\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3575\n10.1124/jpet.119.257717\n10.20517/cdr.2019.105\n10.18632/oncotarget.26652\n10.1172/JCI41402\n10.1172/JCI88410\n10.1371/journal.pone.0051363\n10.5772/55388\n10.15252/embj.201796697\n10.1101/gad.1599207\n10.4161/auto.19496\n10.1007/978-3-319-28305-0\n10.1016/j.molcel.2013.12.014\n10.4161/cc.21884\n10.3389/fonc.2017.00051\n10.1038/nrc2718\n10.1038/onc.2008.117\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1604\n10.7150/thno.30308\n10.1016/j.trecan.2016.11.006\n10.1080/10428194.2017.1376741\n10.1172/JCI73941\n10.1152/ajpcell.00390.2018\n10.1002/jcb.24102\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1733\n10.3390/cancers11091242\n10.1186/bcr3039\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-1185\n10.1056/NEJMoa1505270\n10.1056/NEJMoa1911149\n10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30292-4\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-16-0095\n10.3390/cancers11111661\n10.1200/JCO.2017.75.6155\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.20312\n10.1016/j.breast.2018.08.096\n10.1016/j.clbc.2020.05.013\n10.1016/j.breast.2019.05.001\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0816\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-0425\n10.1016/j.molcel.2009.10.018\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.11.132\n10.1186/s11658-016-0031-z\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1083\n10.1038/onc.2010.74\n10.21037/gs-20-546\n10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.06.018\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4139\n10.1152/ajpcell.00421.2019\n10.4161/auto.5.7.9227\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-1555\n10.1038/s41467-019-11174-0\n10.1016/j.molmed.2013.04.005\n10.1080/14737140.2018.1458615\n10.3389/fimmu.2018.02941\n10.1186/s12943-019-1085-0\n10.1136/gutjnl-2017-315537\n10.1146/annurev-pathmechdis-012418-012818\n10.3389/fimmu.2020.01620"}

However, the optimal therapeutic strategy for patients with HER2+ and lymph node-negative (LN-) breast cancer remains unclear. This population-based study aimed to explore the factors associated with survival in patients with HER2+ and LN- breast cancer, and develop a survival-predicting nomogram in the era of trastuzumab-based single-targeted therapy.\nWe collected the clinicopathological information of HER2+ and LN- breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy and surgery from The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010-2016, the Trastuzumab-based single-targeted therapy era). We subsequently explored the risk factors for breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, aiming to identify subgroups with worse prognosis, which would indicate potential demand for dual-targeted therapy. Three- and 5-year survival probability-predictive nomograms were established and subjected to bootstrap internal validation. The concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were applied to evaluate the performance of the model.\nAfter data cleansing, a total of 13,755 patients were included in the current analysis. Using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, higher clinical T stage, hormone receptors-negative (HR-), and partial mastectomy without radiotherapy were identified as independent risk factors for BCSS and OS in patients with HER2+ and LN- breast cancer. Nomograms for 3- and 5-year BCSS and OS incorporating the selected prognostic factors were established. Calibration curves verified good consistency between the actual and nomogram-predicted survival probability. The C-index values of the BCSS and OS predictions and 95% confidence interval (CI) were 0.773 (0.740-0.806) and 0.764 (0.737-0.791), respectively.\nHigher clinical T stage, HR-, and partial mastectomy without radiotherapy predicted worse prognosis in patients with HER2+ and LN- breast cancer.

This article aims to systematically evaluate the OFS-based adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal breast cancer.\nWe searched several public databases from January 1980 to November 2020. A random model was adopted in this meta-analysis. We used the hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the statistical analysis of efficacy. The primary outcome measures included overall survival and disease-free survival.\nA total of 32 articles with 37,224 cases were included in this network meta-analysis. OFS+TAM improved 5-year disease-free survival (HR -0.09, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01) and 5-year overall survival (HR -0.18, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.03) compared with TAM monotherapy. For OFS+AI, although the 5-year disease-free survival was improved (HR -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.08), the 5-year overall survival was not improved (HR -0.13, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.18). In subgroup analysis, both OFS+AI and OFS+TAM showed a protective effect in stage I-III patients compared with stage I-II patients. For the course of therapy, OFS+TAM for 2-years could achieve clinical benefit and the best course of therapy of OFS+AI still waits for further study.\nOFS+TAM might be a better option than OFS+AI for premenopausal intensive adjuvant endocrine therapy. Stage III patients are more suitable for the OFS-based therapy. For the medication duration, the 2-years course of OFS+TAM could be effective. This analysis provides helpful information for selecting therapeutic regimen in intensive adjuvant endocrine therapy and identifying the target population.", "journal": "Medicine", "date": "2021-08-21", "authors": ["MengjieJiang", "WuzhenChen", "YujieHu", "ChaoChen", "HuafengLi"], "doi": "10.1097/MD.0000000000026949"}
{"title": "Pyrotinib treatment enhances the radiosensitivity in HER2-positive brain metastatic breast cancer patients.", "abstract": "Brain metastasis is a common cause of death in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Currently, it is mainly treated by whole-brain radiotherapy. Pyrotinib is an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor, which has demonstrated promising tumor-suppressing activity and acceptable tolerance in previous phase trials. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of pyrotinib on HER2-positive brain metastatic breast cancer patients treated with whole-brain radiotherapy. A total of 20 such patients were separated into pyrotinib plus capecitabine and capecitabine-only groups in a 1:1 ratio. All patients met either the primary or secondary endpoints. Oral admission of pyrotinib together with radiotherapy can significantly increase the overall response rate, progression-free survival, time to progression and duration of response of HER2+ brain metastatic breast cancer patients, without causing extra adverse events. In addition, pyrotinib can enhance the radiosensitivity of in-vitro cultured HER2+ breast cancer cell lines.

However, there is minimal literature of clinical implementations of such algorithms in a clinical routine. In this paper we first present an update of the state-of-the-art of DL-based solutions. We then summarize recent recommendations proposed by the European society for radiotherapy and oncology (ESTRO) to be followed before any clinical implementation of artificial intelligence-based solutions in clinic. The last section describes the methodology carried out by three French radiation oncology departments to deploy CE-marked commercial solutions. Based on the information collected, a majority of OAR are retained by the centers among those proposed by the manufacturers, validating the usefulness of DL-based models to decrease clinicians' workload. Target volumes, with the exception of lymph node areas in breast, head and neck and pelvic regions, whole breast, breast wall, prostate and seminal vesicles, are not available in the three commercial solutions at this time. No implemented workflows are currently available to continuously improve the models, but these can be adapted/retrained in some solutions during the commissioning phase to best fit local practices. In reported experiences, automatic workflows were implemented to limit human interactions and make the workflow more fluid. Recommendations published by the ESTRO group will be of importance for guiding physicists in the clinical implementation of patient specific and regular quality assurances.", "journal": "Cancer radiotherapie : journal de la Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique", "date": "2021-08-15", "authors": ["CRobert", "AMunoz", "DMoreau", "JMazurier", "GSidorski", "AGasnier", "GBeldjoudi", "VGr\u00e9goire", "EDeutsch", "PMeyer", "LSimon"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canrad.2021.06.023"}

Whether RNF126 is modulated by posttranslational modifications is poorly understood. Here, we show that PARP1 interacts with and poly(ADP)ribosylates RNF126, which then recruits the PAR-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase CHFR to promote ubiquitination and degradation of RNF126. Moreover, RNF126 is required for the activation of ATR-Chk1 signaling induced by either irradiation (IR) or a PARP inhibitor (PARPi), and depletion of RNF126 increases the sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells to PARPi treatment. Our findings suggest that PARPi-mediated upregulation of RNF126 protein stability contributes to TNBC cell resistance to PARPi.

{"title": "Systemic PPAR\u03b3 Antagonism Reduces Metastatic Tumor Progression in Adipocyte-Rich Bone in Excess Weight Male Rodents.", "abstract": "Primary tumors are widely associated with an excess in body fat. The role of adipose tissue on tumor cell homing to bone is yet poorly defined. In this study, we aimed to assess whether bone colonization by tumor cells is favored by an adipocyte-rich bone marrow. We delineated the accompanying alterations of the bone microenvironment and established a treatment approach that interferes with high fat diet (HFD)-induced bone metastasis formation. We were able to show that adipocytes affect skeletal tumor growth in a metastatic model of breast cancer in male rats and melanoma in male mice as well as in human breast cancer bone biopsies. Indeed, HFD-induced bone marrow adiposity was accompanied by accelerated tumor progression and increased osteolytic lesions. In human bone metastases, bone marrow adiposity correlated with tumor cell proliferation. By antagonization of the adipocyte differentiation and storage pathway linked to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) with bisphenol-A-diglycidylether (BADGE), we were able to decelerate tumor progression and subsequent osteolytic damage in the bones of two distinct metastatic animal models exposed to HFD. Overall these data show that adipose tissue is a critical factor in bone metastases and cancer-induced bone loss. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

{"title": "Therapeutic Options for the Management of Aromatase Inhibitor- Associated Bone Loss.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women worldwide. Early breast cancer is a kind of invasive neoplasm that has not proliferated beyond the breast or the axillary lymph nodes. Current therapeutic strategies for breast cancer mainly include local therapies such as surgery or radiotherapy and systemic therapies like chemotherapy, endocrine, and targeted therapy. Nowadays, the adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women remains the main effective systemic therapy which can improve disease- free survival and overall survival; it involves several endocrine treatment regimens, including Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs), or a combination of them. AIs have been shown to be more effective in preventing recurrence in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer when compared with tamoxifen, thus representing the standard of care for adjuvant endocrine therapy. Although AIs are usually well-tolerated, they can have some side effects. Apart from the appearance of arthralgias or myalgias and cardiovascular events, AI therapies, reducing already low endogenous postmenopausal estradiol levels, cause increased bone loss and increase fracture risk in postmenopausal women.\nThe objective of this review is to evaluate the therapeutic options in the management of Aromatase Inhibitor-Associated Bone Loss (AIBL).\nWe reviewed the current literature dealing with different therapeutic options in the treatment of AIBL.\nClinical practice guidelines recommend a careful evaluation of skeletal health in all women with breast cancer before AI therapy initiation. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake have also been suggested. Pharmacological attempts to minimize AI-related bone loss have focused on the use of antiresorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab to protect bone integrity and reduce the risk of fractures. Furthermore, clinical trials have shown that by making the bone microenvironment less susceptible to breast cancer metastasis, these drugs are able to increase disease- free survival.\nAI, that are the pillar of the systemic treatment for patients with hormone receptorpositive breast cancer, are associated with different side effects, and in particular, osteoporosis and fractures.

The databases of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were applied to analyze pathway enrichment. The plasma samples were then collected from 55 patients with recently diagnosed rectal cancer and 10 healthy subjects. For radiotherapy courses, the patients have consecutively received 30 sessions of local radiation for six weeks. At last, the expression of selected genes and miRNAs was experimentally measured before and after radiotherapy by qPCR, and the protein levels of the target genes were measured by ELISA assay. We evaluated the therapeutic responses based on the tumor regression grade of the Dworak classification.\nWe identified 5 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated miRNAs and 8 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated genes of the databases. There was a significant increase in tumor suppressor miRNAs, including miR-101-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-34a-5p, and a significant decrease in oncomiRs, including miR-221-3p and miR-17-5p, after radiotherapy compared to the pre-treatment. Moreover, the up-regulated miR-17-5p and miR-221-5p and the down-regulated miR-101-3p and miR-145-5p were directly related to rectal cancer through the interaction with the Wnt, RAS, PI3K, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways.

To provide new insights of the mechanisms underlying radioresistance, we established radioresistant cell lines derived from two different subtypes of breast cancer cells, HER2-positive SK-BR-3 and ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, by exposing cells to 48\u00a0~\u00a070\u00a0Gy of radiation delivered at 4-5\u00a0Gy twice weekly over 9\u00a0~\u00a010\u00a0months. The established radioresistant SK-BR-3 (SR) and MCF-7 (MR) cells were resistant not only to a single dose of radiation (2\u00a0Gy or 4\u00a0Gy) but also to fractionated radiation delivered at 2\u00a0Gy/day for 5\u00a0days. Furthermore, these cells exhibited tumor-initiating potential in vivo and high CD24-/CD44\u00a0+\u00a0ratio. To identify novel therapeutic molecular targets, we analyzed differentially expressed genes in both radioresistant cell lines and found that the expression of ACSL4 was significantly elevated in both cell lines. Targeting ACSL4 improved response to irradiation and inhibited migration activities. Furthermore, inhibition of ACLS4 using ASCL4 siRNA or triacsin C suppressed FOXM1 expression, whereas inhibition of FOXM1 using thiostrepton did not affect ACSL4 expression. Targeting the ACSL4-FOXM1 signaling axis by inhibiting ASCL4 or FOXM1 overcame the radioresistance by suppressing DNA damage responses and inducing apoptosis. This is the first study to report that ACSL4 plays a crucial role in mediating the radioresistance of breast cancer by regulating FOXM1. We propose the ACSL4-FOXM1 signaling axis be considered a novel therapeutic target in radioresistant breast cancer and suggest treatment strategies targeting this signaling axis might overcome breast cancer radioresistance.", "journal": "Biochemical pharmacology", "date": "2021-08-07", "authors": ["Yun-SukKwon", "Min-GuLee", "JunyoungBaek", "Nam-YiKim", "HyunsooJang", "SoyoungKim"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bcp.2021.114718"}

{"title": "Patterns of Metastatic Disease in Patients with Cancer Derived from Natural Language Processing of Structured CT Radiology Reports over a 10-year Period.", "abstract": "Background Patterns of metastasis in cancer are increasingly relevant to prognostication and treatment planning but have historically been documented by means of autopsy series. Purpose To show the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP) to gather accurate data from radiology reports for assessing spatial and temporal patterns of metastatic spread in a large patient cohort. Materials and Methods In this retrospective longitudinal study, consecutive patients who underwent CT from July 2009 to April 2019 and whose CT reports followed a departmental structured template were included. Three radiologists manually curated a sample of 2219 reports for the presence or absence of metastases across 13 organs; these manually curated reports were used to develop three NLP models with an 80%-20% split for training and test sets. A separate random sample of 448 manually curated reports was used for validation. Model performance was measured by accuracy, precision, and recall for each organ. The best-performing NLP model was used to generate a final database of metastatic disease across all patients. For each cancer type, statistical descriptive reports were provided by analyzing the frequencies of metastatic disease at the report and patient levels. Results In 91\u2009665 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 61 years \u00b1 15; 46\u2009939 women), 387\u2009359 reports were labeled. The best-performing NLP model achieved accuracies from 90% to 99% across all organs. Metastases were most frequently reported in abdominopelvic (23.6% of all reports) and thoracic (17.6%) nodes, followed by lungs (14.7%), liver (13.7%), and bones (9.9%). Metastatic disease tropism is distinct among common cancers, with the most common first site being bones in prostate and breast cancers and liver among pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Conclusion Natural language processing may be applied to cancer patients' CT reports to generate a large database of metastatic phenotypes. Such a database could be combined with genomic studies and used to explore prognostic imaging phenotypes with relevance to treatment planning. \u00a9 RSNA, 2021 ", "journal": "Radiology", "date": "2021-08-04", "authors": ["Richard K GDo", "KaelanLupton", "Pamela ICausa Andrieu", "AnishaLuthra", "MichioTaya", "KarenBatch", "HuyNguyen", "PrachiRahurkar", "LiorGazit", "KevinNicholas", "Christopher JFong", "NatalieGangai", "NikolausSchultz", "FarhanaZulkernine", "VaradanSevilimedu", "KrishnaJuluru", "AmberSimpson", "HedvigHricak"], "doi": "10.1148/radiol.2021210043"}
{"title": "Breast Cancer Segmentation Methods: Current Status and Future Potentials.", "abstract": "Early breast cancer detection is one of the most important issues that need to be addressed worldwide as it can help increase the survival rate of patients. Mammograms have been used to detect breast cancer in the early stages; if detected in the early stages, it can drastically reduce treatment costs. The detection of tumours in the breast depends on segmentation techniques. Segmentation plays a significant role in image analysis and includes detection, feature extraction, classification, and treatment. Segmentation helps physicians quantify the volume of tissue in the breast for treatment planning. In this work, we have grouped segmentation methods into three groups: classical segmentation that includes region-, threshold-, and edge-based segmentation; machine learning segmentation; and supervised and unsupervised and deep learning segmentation. The findings of our study revealed that region-based segmentation is frequently used for classical methods, and the most frequently used techniques are region growing. Further, a median filter is a robust tool for removing noise. Moreover, the MIAS database is frequently used in classical segmentation methods. Meanwhile, in machine learning segmentation, unsupervised machine learning methods are more frequently used, and U-Net is frequently used for mammogram image segmentation because it does not require many annotated images compared with other deep learning models. Furthermore, reviewed papers revealed that it is possible to train a deep learning model without performing any preprocessing or postprocessing and also showed that the U-Net model is frequently used for mammogram segmentation. The U-Net model is frequently used because it does not require many annotated images and also because of the presence of high-performance GPU computing, which makes it easy to train networks with more layers.

{"title": "ACSL family: The regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic implications in cancer.", "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that deregulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism is associated with the development of cancer. Long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthases (ACSLs) are responsible for activating long-chain FAs and are frequently deregulated in cancers. Among the five mammalian ACSL family members, ACSL1 is involved in the TNF\u03b1-mediated pro-inflammatory phenotype and mainly facilitates cancer progression. ACSL3 is an androgen-responsive gene. High ACSL3 expression has been detected in a variety of cancers, including melanoma, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and high-grade non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and correlates with worse prognosis of patients with these diseases. ACSL4 can exert opposing roles acting as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene depending on the specific cancer type and tissue environment. Moreover, ACSL4 behaves as a crucial regulator in ferroptosis that is defined as a cell death process caused by iron-dependent peroxidation of lipids. ACSL5 is nuclear-coded and expressed in the mitochondria and physiologically participates in the pro-apoptotic sensing of cells. ACSL5 mainly acts as a tumor suppressor in cancers. ACSL6 downregulation has been observed in many forms of cancers, except in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we address the differential regulatory mechanisms of the ACSL family members as well as their functions in carcinogenesis. Moreover, we enumerate the clinical therapeutic implications of ACSLs, which might serve as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision cancer treatment.", "journal": "European journal of pharmacology", "date": "2021-08-02", "authors": ["JingQuan", "Ann MBode", "XiangjianLuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174397"}

{"title": "xDeep-AcPEP: Deep Learning Method for Anticancer Peptide Activity Prediction Based on Convolutional Neural Network and Multitask Learning.", "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Conventional cancer treatment relies on radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but both methods bring severe side effects to patients, as these therapies not only attack cancer cells but also damage normal cells. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are a promising alternative as therapeutic agents that are efficient and selective against tumor cells. Here, we propose a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks to predict biological activity (EC50, LC50, IC50, and LD50) against six tumor cells, including breast, colon, cervix, lung, skin, and prostate. We show that models derived with multitask learning achieve better performance than conventional single-task models. In repeated 5-fold cross validation using the CancerPPD data set, the best models with the applicability domain defined obtain an average mean squared error of 0.1758, Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.8086, and Kendall's correlation coefficient of 0.6156. As a step toward model interpretability, we infer the contribution of each residue in the sequence to the predicted activity by means of feature importance weights derived from the convolutional layers of the model. The present method, referred to as xDeep-AcPEP, will help to identify effective ACPs in rational peptide design for therapeutic purposes.

{"title": "Saliency-guided deep learning network for automatic tumor bed volume delineation in post-operative breast irradiation.", "abstract": "Efficient, reliable and reproducible target volume delineation is a key step in the effective planning of breast radiotherapy. However, post-operative breast target delineation is challenging as the contrast between the tumor bed volume (TBV) and normal breast tissue is relatively low in CT images. In this study, we propose to mimic the marker-guidance procedure in manual target delineation. We developed a saliency-based deep learning segmentation (SDL-Seg) algorithm for accurate TBV segmentation in post-operative breast irradiation. The SDL-Seg algorithm incorporates saliency information in the form of markers' location cues into a U-Net model. The design forces the model to encode the location-related features, which underscores regions with high saliency levels and suppresses low saliency regions. The saliency maps were generated by identifying markers on CT images. Markers' location were then converted to probability maps using a distance transformation coupled with a Gaussian filter. Subsequently, the CT images and the corresponding saliency maps formed a multi-channel input for the SDL-Seg network. Our in-house dataset was comprised of 145 prone CT images from 29 post-operative breast cancer patients, who received 5-fraction partial breast irradiation (PBI) regimen on GammaPod. The 29 patients were randomly split into training (19), validation (5) and test (5) sets. The performance of the proposed method was compared against basic U-Net. Our model achieved mean (standard deviation) of 76.4(\u00b12.7) %, 6.76(\u00b11.83) mm, and 1.9(\u00b10.66) mm for Dice similarity coefficient, 95 percentile Hausdorff distance, and average symmetric surface distance respectively on the test set with computation time of below 11 seconds per one CT volume. SDL-Seg showed superior performance relative to basic U-Net for all the evaluation metrics while preserving low computation cost. The findings demonstrate that SDL-Seg is a promising approach for improving the efficiency and accuracy of the on-line treatment planning procedure of PBI, such as GammaPod based PBI.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2021-07-24", "authors": ["MahdiehKazemimoghadam", "WeichengChi", "AsalRahimi", "NathanKim", "PrasannaAlluri", "ChikaNwachukwu", "WeiguoLu", "XuejunGu"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/ac176d"}
{"title": "3D deformable registration of longitudinal abdominopelvic CT images using unsupervised deep learning.", "abstract": "Deep learning is being increasingly used for deformable image registration and unsupervised approaches, in particular, have shown great potential. However, the registration of abdominopelvic Computed Tomography (CT) images remains challenging due to the larger displacements compared to those in brain or prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets that are typically considered as benchmarks. In this study, we investigate the use of the commonly used unsupervised deep learning framework VoxelMorph for the registration of a longitudinal abdominopelvic CT dataset acquired in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer.\nAs a pre-processing step, the abdominopelvic CT images were refined by automatically removing the CT table and all other extra-corporeal components. To improve the learning capabilities of the VoxelMorph framework when only a limited amount of training data is available, a novel incremental training strategy is proposed based on simulated deformations of consecutive CT images in the longitudinal dataset. This devised training strategy was compared against training on simulated deformations of a single CT volume. A widely used software toolbox for deformable image registration called NiftyReg was used as a benchmark. The evaluations were performed by calculating the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) between manual vertebrae segmentations and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).\nThe CT table removal procedure allowed both VoxelMorph and NiftyReg to achieve significantly better registration performance. In a 4-fold cross-validation scheme, the incremental training strategy resulted in better registration performance compared to training on a single volume, with a mean DSC of 0.929\u00b10.037 and 0.883\u00b10.033, and a mean SSIM of 0.984\u00b10.009 and 0.969\u00b10.007, respectively. Although our deformable image registration method did not outperform NiftyReg in terms of DSC (0.988\u00b10.003) or SSIM (0.995\u00b10.002), the registrations were approximately 300 times faster.\nThis study showed the feasibility of deep learning based deformable registration of longitudinal abdominopelvic CT images via a novel incremental training strategy based on simulated deformations.", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "date": "2021-07-22", "authors": ["Maureenvan Eijnatten", "LeonardoRundo", "K JoostBatenburg", "FelixLucka", "EmmaBeddowes", "CarlosCaldas", "Ferdia AGallagher", "EvisSala", "Carola-BibianeSch\u00f6nlieb", "RamonaWoitek"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106261"}

For each patient, the tumor(s) and the parenchyma were independently segmented and analyzed with radiomic analysis to extract shape, size, and texture features. Several sets of features were realized based on the 4 different sequence images.

{"title": "A data science approach for early-stage prediction of Patient's susceptibility to acute side effects of advanced radiotherapy.", "abstract": "The prediction by classification of side effects incidence in a given medical treatment is a common challenge in medical research. Machine Learning (ML) methods are widely used in the areas of risk prediction and classification. The primary objective of such algorithms is to use several features to predict dichotomous responses (e.g., disease positive/negative). Similar to statistical inference modelling, ML modelling is subject to the class imbalance problem and is affected by the majority class, increasing the false-negative rate. In this study, seventy-nine ML models were built and evaluated to classify approximately 2000 participants from 26 hospitals in eight different countries into two groups of radiotherapy (RT) side effects incidence based on recorded observations from the international study of RT related toxicity \"REQUITE\". We also examined the effect of sampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning methods on the models when dealing with class imbalance. The combinations of such techniques used had a significant impact on the classification. They resulted in an improvement in incidence status prediction by shifting classifiers' attention to the minority group. The best classification model for RT acute toxicity prediction was identified based on domain experts' success criteria. The Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristic curve of the models tested with an isolated dataset ranged from 0.50 to 0.77. The scale of improved results is promising and will guide further development of models to predict RT acute toxicities. One model was optimised and found to be beneficial to identify patients who are at risk of developing acute RT early-stage toxicities as a result of undergoing breast RT ensuring relevant treatment interventions can be appropriately targeted. The design of the approach presented in this paper resulted in producing a preclinical-valid prediction model.

{"title": "A convolutional neural network algorithm for breast tumor detection with magnetic detection electrical impedance tomography.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is a malignant tumor disease for which early detection, diagnosis, and treatment are of paramount significance in prolonging the life of patients. Magnetic Detection Electrical Impedance Tomography (MDEIT) based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which aims to realize non-invasive, high resolution detection of breast tumors, is proposed. First, the MDEIT forward problem of the coronal and horizontal planes of the breast was simulated and solved using the Finite Element Method to obtain sample datasets of different lesions. Then, the CNN was built and trained to predict the conductivity distribution in different orientations of the breast model. Finally, noise and phantom experiments were performed in order to assess the anti-noise performance of the CNN algorithm and its feasibility of detecting breast tumors in practical applications. The simulation results showed that the reconstruction relative error with the CNN algorithm can be reduced to 10%, in comparison with the truncated singular value decomposition algorithm and back propagation algorithm. The CNN algorithm had better stability in the anti-noise performance test. When the noise of 60 dB was added, the shape of the breast tumor could still be restored by the CNN algorithm. The phantom experimental results showed that through the CNN based reconstruction algorithm, the reconstruction conductivity distribution image was legible and the position of the breast tumor could be determined. It is reasonable to conclude that the MDEIT reconstruction method proposed in this study has practical importance for the early and non-invasive detection of breast tumors.", "journal": "The Review of scientific instruments", "date": "2021-07-11", "authors": ["RuijuanChen", "SongsongZhao", "WeiweiWu", "ZhihuiSun", "JinhaiWang", "HuiquanWang", "GuangHan"], "doi": "10.1063/5.0041423"}
{"title": "Early prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response by exploiting a transfer learning approach on breast DCE-MRIs.", "abstract": "The dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging plays a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) even since its early stage through the prediction of the final pathological complete response (pCR). In this study, we proposed a transfer learning approach to predict if a patient achieved pCR (pCR) or did not (non-pCR) by exploiting, separately or in combination, pre-treatment and early-treatment exams from I-SPY1 TRIAL public database. First, low-level features, i.e., related to local structure of the image, were automatically extracted by a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) overcoming manual feature extraction. Next, an optimal set of most stable features was detected and then used to design an SVM classifier. A first subset of patients, called fine-tuning dataset (30 pCR; 78 non-pCR), was used to perform the optimal choice of features. A second subset not involved in the feature selection process was employed as an independent test (7 pCR; 19 non-pCR) to validate the model. By combining the optimal features extracted from both pre-treatment and early-treatment exams with some clinical features, i.e., ER, PgR, HER2 and molecular subtype, an accuracy of 91.4% and 92.3%, and an AUC value of 0.93 and 0.90, were returned on the fine-tuning dataset and the independent test, respectively. Overall, the low-level CNN features have an important role in the early evaluation of the NAC efficacy by predicting pCR.

Therefore, we aimed to use machine learning techniques to develop an efficient preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics evaluation approach of ALN status and explore the association between radiomics and the tumor microenvironment in patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer.\nin this retrospective multicenter study, three independent cohorts of patients with breast cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a01,088) were used to develop and validate signatures predictive of ALN status. After applying the machine learning random forest algorithm to select the key preoperative MRI radiomic features, we used ALN and tumor radiomic features to develop the ALN-tumor radiomic signature for ALN status prediction by the support vector machine algorithm in 803 patients with breast cancer from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (training cohort). By combining ALN and tumor radiomic features with corresponding clinicopathologic information, the multiomic signature was constructed in the training cohort. Next, the external validation cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0179) of patients from Shunde Hospital of Southern Medical University and Tungwah Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, and the prospective-retrospective validation cohort (n\u00a0= 106) of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in prospective phase 3 trials [NCT01503905], were included to evaluate the predictive value of the two signatures, and their predictive performance was assessed by the area under operating characteristic curve (AUC). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04003558.\nthe ALN-tumor radiomic signature for ALN status prediction comprising ALN and tumor radiomic features showed a high prediction quality with AUC of 0\u00b788 in the training cohort, 0\u00b787 in the external validation cohort, and 0\u00b787 in the prospective-retrospective validation cohort. The multiomic signature incorporating tumor and lymph node MRI radiomics, clinical and pathologic characteristics, and molecular subtypes achieved better performance for ALN status prediction with AUCs of 0\u00b790, 0\u00b791, and 0\u00b793 in the training cohort, the external validation cohort, and the prospective-retrospective validation cohort, respectively. Among patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the prospective-retrospective validation cohort, there were significant differences in the key radiomic features before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially in the gray-level dependence matrix features. Furthermore, there was an association between MRI radiomics and tumor microenvironment features including immune cells, long non-coding RNAs, and types of methylated sites. Interpretation this study presented a multiomic signature that could be preoperatively and conveniently used for identifying patients with ALN metastasis in early-stage invasive breast cancer. The multiomic signature exhibited powerful predictive ability and showed the prospect of extended application to tailor surgical management. Besides, significant changes in key radiomic features after neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be explained by changes in the tumor microenvironment, and the association between MRI radiomic features and tumor microenvironment features may reveal the potential biological underpinning of MRI radiomics.\nNo funding.", "journal": "EBioMedicine", "date": "2021-07-08", "authors": ["YunfangYu", "ZifanHe", "JieOuyang", "YujieTan", "YongjianChen", "YangGu", "LuhuiMao", "WeiRen", "JueWang", "LiliLin", "ZhuoWu", "JingwenLiu", "QiyunOu", "QiugenHu", "AnlinLi", "KaiChen", "ChenchenLi", "NianLu", "XiaohongLi", "FengxiSu", "QiangLiu", "ChuanmiaoXie", "HeruiYao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103460"}

{"title": "Recent Radiomics Advancements in Breast Cancer: Lessons and Pitfalls for the Next Future.", "abstract": "Radiomics is an emerging translational field of medicine based on the extraction of high-dimensional data from radiological images, with the purpose to reach reliable models to be applied into clinical practice for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis and evaluation of disease response to treatment. We aim to provide the basic information on radiomics to radiologists and clinicians who are focused on breast cancer care, encouraging cooperation with scientists to mine data for a better application in clinical practice. We investigate the workflow and clinical application of radiomics in breast cancer care, as well as the outlook and challenges based on recent studies. Currently, radiomics has the potential ability to distinguish between benign and malignant breast lesions, to predict breast cancer's molecular subtypes, the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the lymph node metastases. Even though radiomics has been used in tumor diagnosis and prognosis, it is still in the research phase and some challenges need to be faced to obtain a clinical translation. In this review, we discuss the current limitations and promises of radiomics for improvement in further research.", "journal": "Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["FilippoPesapane", "AnnaRotili", "Giorgio MariaAgazzi", "FrancescaBotta", "SaraRaimondi", "SilviaPenco", "ValeriaDominelli", "MartaCremonesi", "Barbara AlicjaJereczek-Fossa", "GianpaoloCarrafiello", "EnricoCassano"], "doi": "10.3390/curroncol28040217\n10.1186/s41747-018-0061-6\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000358\n10.1007/s12032-020-01353-1\n10.1016/j.tranon.2020.100831\n10.1016/j.acra.2020.10.020\n10.1016/j.acra.2019.11.004\n10.1016/j.breast.2019.10.018\n10.1148/radiol.2018172171\n10.3322/caac.21660\n10.2147/CMAR.S174435\n10.1148/rg.2018180047\n10.6004/jnccn.2018.0012\n10.1016/j.ejca.2018.08.003\n10.1038/s41598-017-08310-5\n10.1038/nature12625\n10.21037/cco.2019.12.02\n10.1148/radiol.2020191145\n10.3121/cmr.2008.825\n10.1053/ctrv.2000.0207\n10.1093/annonc/mdy537\n10.1007/s10549-019-05402-w\n10.1007/s10549-018-4990-9\n10.1007/s10549-019-05519-y\n10.1007/s13244-012-0196-6\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.10.009\n10.1038/ncomms5006\n10.1016/j.nicl.2016.02.012\n10.1007/s12032-017-0892-7\n10.2217/fon-2017-0655\n10.1148/radiol.12120167\n10.1002/nbm.2882\n10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.2631\n10.3348/kjr.2019.0855\n10.1002/mrm.28521\n10.1007/s00330-020-07016-z\n10.3389/fonc.2020.531476\n10.1007/s00330-020-06991-7\n10.1371/journal.pone.0234871\n10.1002/jmri.27098\n10.1002/jmri.26688\n10.3389/fonc.2019.00505\n10.1016/j.acra.2018.01.006\n10.1259/bjr.20191019\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109309\n10.3389/fonc.2020.573630\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2019.108718\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2019.108711\n10.1002/cam4.2711\n10.1002/jmri.26981\n10.1002/jmri.26852\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2019.108736\n10.1007/s00330-015-3807-z\n10.3892/ol.2018.8805\n10.1148/radiol.2017170273\n10.1148/radiol.2019181113\n10.1016/j.breast.2018.04.016\n10.3390/diagnostics11040684\n10.1038/s41598-019-48488-4\n10.1371/journal.pone.0171683\n10.1007/s00330-018-5804-5\n10.3390/diagnostics10090708\n10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30777-5\n10.3747/co.25.3729\n10.1200/JCO.2017.74.0472\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3190\n10.1007/s12094-019-02109-8\n10.1186/s40644-018-0145-9\n10.1002/nbm.3132\n10.1186/s13058-017-0846-1\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2017.06.019\n10.1002/jmri.23971\n10.1148/radiol.14130569\n10.3389/fonc.2021.605230\n10.1016/S1470-2045(18)30380-2\n10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70035-4\n10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70947-0\n10.1016/j.ejso.2017.10.215\n10.1002/bjs.10583\n10.1002/jmri.26865\n10.1007/s00330-017-5005-7\n10.1007/s00330-018-5981-2\n10.1038/s41598-019-38502-0\n10.1002/jmri.26224\n10.1038/s41598-019-40831-z\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2019.108658\n10.1016/j.acra.2019.11.007\n10.1177/1533033820916191\n10.1038/s41598-020-66110-w\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-0853\n10.1016/j.jvir.2018.01.769\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.2008.03158.x\n10.1016/j.amjmed.2017.10.035\n10.1147/rd.33.0210\n10.3348/kjr.2017.18.4.570\n10.1038/nature14539\n10.1016/j.jacr.2017.12.026\n10.1007/s13244-018-0645-y\n10.1109/TBME.2018.2814538\n10.1016/j.media.2016.05.004\n10.1111/joim.12721\n10.1016/j.jacr.2017.12.037\n10.1016/j.jacr.2005.08.003\n10.1186/s13244-019-0773-z\n10.2196/medinform.5359\n10.1148/radiol.12121502\n10.1148/radiol.11101913\n10.1109/TMI.2016.2538465\n10.1109/TMI.2016.2548501\n10.1016/j.jacr.2017.02.019\n10.1016/j.acra.2015.10.004\n10.1016/j.ejim.2017.06.017\n10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30037-6\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.141\n10.1016/j.radonc.2018.03.033\n10.7326/M14-0697\n10.1148/radiol.2017162056\n10.1038/538020a\n10.2196/13484\n10.1136/svn-2017-000101\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btr360\n10.1109/TMI.2016.2578680\n10.1038/s41591-018-0307-0\n10.1097/SLA.0000000000002693"}
{"title": "Semi-Supervised Deep Learning-Based Image Registration Method with Volume Penalty for Real-Time Breast Tumor Bed Localization.", "abstract": "Breast-conserving surgery requires supportive radiotherapy to prevent cancer recurrence. However, the task of localizing the tumor bed to be irradiated is not trivial. The automatic image registration could significantly aid the tumor bed localization and lower the radiation dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissues. This study proposes a novel image registration method dedicated to breast tumor bed localization addressing the problem of missing data due to tumor resection that may be applied to real-time radiotherapy planning. We propose a deep learning-based nonrigid image registration method based on a modified U-Net architecture. The algorithm works simultaneously on several image resolutions to handle large deformations. Moreover, we propose a dedicated volume penalty that introduces the medical knowledge about tumor resection into the registration process. The proposed method may be useful for improving real-time radiation therapy planning after the tumor resection and, thus, lower the surrounding healthy tissues' irradiation. The data used in this study consist of 30 computed tomography scans acquired in patients with diagnosed breast cancer, before and after tumor surgery. The method is evaluated using the target registration error between manually annotated landmarks, the ratio of tumor volume, and the subjective visual assessment. We compare the proposed method to several other approaches and show that both the multilevel approach and the volume regularization improve the registration results. The mean target registration error is below 6.5 mm, and the relative volume ratio is close to zero. The registration time below 1 s enables the real-time processing. These results show improvements compared to the classical, iterative methods or other learning-based approaches that do not introduce the knowledge about tumor resection into the registration process. In future research, we plan to propose a method dedicated to automatic localization of missing regions that may be used to automatically segment tumors in the source image and scars in the target image.", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "date": "2021-07-03", "authors": ["MarekWodzinski", "IzabelaCiepiela", "TomaszKuszewski", "PiotrKedzierawski", "AndrzejSkalski"], "doi": "10.3390/s21124085\n10.3322/caac.21492\n10.3322/caac.21262\n10.1056/NEJMoa022152\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2014.02.008\n10.1002/mp.13994\n10.1088/1361-6560/aaa4b1\n10.1016/j.media.2005.03.006\n10.1118/1.4747270\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.10.049\n10.1053/ejso.1999.0683\n10.1002/cncr.11142\n10.1016/j.inffus.2021.02.012\n10.1007/s11263-020-01359-2\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.10.040\n10.1109/TMI.2013.2265603\n10.1007/s00138-020-01060-x\n10.1109/TMI.2019.2897538\n10.1016/j.media.2019.07.006\n10.1016/j.media.2019.101545\n10.1016/j.media.2018.11.010\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105799\n10.1016/j.compeleceng.2020.106767\n10.1016/j.media.2018.12.007\n10.1109/TIP.2011.2158338\n10.1016/j.neucom.2018.05.083"}

Here, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network for Distribution Analysis (GANDA) to describe and conditionally generates the intratumoral quantum dots (QDs) distribution after i.v. injection. This deep generative model is trained automatically by 27,775 patches of tumor vessels and cell nuclei decomposed from whole-slide images of 4\u00a0T1 breast cancer sections. The GANDA model can conditionally generate images of intratumoral QDs distribution under the constraint of given tumor vessels and cell nuclei channels with the same spatial resolution (pixels-to-pixels), minimal loss (mean squared error, MSE\u00a0=\u00a01.871) and excellent reliability (intraclass correlation, ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.94). Quantitative analysis of QDs extravasation distance (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.95) and subarea distribution (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.99) is allowed on the generated images without knowing the real QDs distribution.

In this study, we evaluated changes in the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone microstructure associated with AI treatment using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in patients with early breast cancer.\nThis prospective, single-arm, observational study included non-osteoporotic, postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Patients underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), HR-pQCT, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b) or procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide measurements at baseline and 6 and 12\u00a0months after AI therapy.

{"title": "Machine learning classification of texture features of MRI breast tumor and peri-tumor of combined pre- and early treatment predicts pathologic complete response.", "abstract": "This study used machine learning classification of texture features from MRI of breast tumor and peri-tumor at multiple treatment time points in conjunction with molecular subtypes to predict eventual pathological complete response (PCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nThis study employed a subset of patients (N\u2009=\u2009166) with PCR data from the I-SPY-1 TRIAL (2002-2006). This cohort consisted of patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer that underwent anthracycline-cyclophosphamide and taxane treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, early, and mid-treatment. Texture features were extracted from post-contrast-enhanced MRI, pre- and post-contrast subtraction images, and with morphological dilation to include peri-tumoral tissue. Molecular subtypes and Ki67 were also included in the prediction model. Performance of classification models used the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis including area under the curve (AUC). Statistical analysis was done using unpaired two-tailed t-tests.\nMolecular subtypes alone yielded moderate prediction performance of PCR (AUC\u2009=\u20090.82, p\u2009=\u20090.07). Pre-, early, and mid-treatment data alone yielded moderate performance (AUC\u2009=\u20090.88, 0.72, and 0.78, p\u2009=\u20090.03, 0.13, 0.44, respectively). The combined pre- and early treatment data markedly improved performance (AUC\u2009=\u20090.96, p\u2009=\u20090.0003). Addition of molecular subtypes improved performance slightly for individual time points but substantially for the combined pre- and early treatment (AUC\u2009=\u20090.98, p\u2009=\u20090.0003). The optimal morphological dilation was 3-5 pixels. Subtraction of post- and pre-contrast MRI further improved performance (AUC\u2009=\u20090.98, p\u2009=\u20090.00003).

We now demonstrate that Claudin-2 is functionally required for colorectal cancer liver metastasis and that Claudin-2 expression in primary colorectal cancers is associated with poor overall and liver metastasis-free survival. We have examined the role of Claudin-2, and other claudin family members, as potential prognostic biomarkers of the desmoplastic and replacement histopathological growth pattern associated with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed higher Claudin-2 levels in replacement type metastases when compared to those with desmoplastic features. In contrast, Claudin-8 was highly expressed in desmoplastic colorectal cancer liver metastases. Similar observations were made following immunohistochemical staining of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that we have established, which faithfully retain the histopathology of desmoplastic or replacement type colorectal cancer liver metastases. We provide evidence that Claudin-2 status in patient-derived extracellular vesicles may serve as a relevant prognostic biomarker to predict whether colorectal cancer patients have developed replacement type liver metastases.

{"title": "Syndecan-1 Depletion Has a Differential Impact on Hyaluronic Acid Metabolism and Tumor Cell Behavior in Luminal and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.", "abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans (PGs) are major components of the glycocalyx. The secreted GAG and CD44 ligand hyaluronic acid (HA), and the cell surface PG syndecan-1 (Sdc-1) modulate the expression and activity of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules, acting as critical regulators of tumor cell behavior. Here, we studied the effect of Sdc-1 siRNA depletion and HA treatment on hallmark processes of cancer in breast cancer cell lines of different levels of aggressiveness. We analyzed HA synthesis, and parameters relevant to tumor progression, including the stem cell phenotype, Wnt signaling constituents, cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and angiogenic markers in luminal MCF-7 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Sdc-1 knockdown enhanced HAS-2 synthesis and HA binding in MCF-7, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. Sdc-1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells showed a reduced CD24-/CD44+ population. Furthermore, Sdc-1 depletion was associated with survival signals in both cell lines, affecting cell cycle progression and apoptosis evasion. These changes were linked to the altered expression of KLF4, MSI2, and miR-10b and differential changes in Erk, Akt, and PTEN signaling.

Cultured HCC1806 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with FK866 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) inhibitor), FX11 (lactate dehydrogenase A inhibitor), paclitaxel, and their combinations were subjected to ORI, followed by imaging fluorescently labeled reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell growth inhibition was measured by a cell viability assay. We found that both cell lines experienced significant NADH decrease and redox ratio (Fp/(NADH+Fp)) increase due to FK866 treatment; however, HCC1806 was much more responsive than MDA-MB-231. We further studied HCC1806 with the main findings: (i) nicotinamide riboside (NR) partially restored NADH in FK866-treated cells; (ii) FX11 induced an over 3-fold NADH increase in FK866 or FK866+NR pretreated cells; (iii) FK866 combined with paclitaxel caused synergistic increases in both Fp and the redox ratio; (iv) FK866 sensitized cells to paclitaxel treatments, which agrees with the redox changes detected by ORI; (v) Fp and the redox ratio positively correlated with cell growth inhibition; and (vi) Fp and NADH positively correlated with ROS level.

A total of 292 breast cancer patients, with 320 tumors, who were treated with neo-adjuvant systemic therapy and underwent a pretreatment MRI exam were enrolled. As the data were collected in two different hospitals with five different MRI scanners and varying acquisition protocols, three different strategies to split training and validation datasets were used. Radiomics, clinical, and combined models were developed using random forest classifiers in each strategy. The analysis of radiomics features had no added value in predicting pathologic complete tumor response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer patients compared with the clinical models, nor did the combined models perform significantly better than the clinical models. Further, the radiomics features selected for the models and their performance differed with and within the different strategies. Due to previous and current work, we tentatively attribute the lack of improvement in clinical models following the addition of radiomics to the effects of variations in acquisition and reconstruction parameters. The lack of reproducibility data (i.e., test-retest or similar) meant that this effect could not be analyzed.

A major obstacle for DC-based immunotherapy is the difficulty to obtain a sufficient number of functional DCs.

We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating all adjuvant treatment strategies for DCIS.\nA Markov model was created with six competing treatment strategies: observation, tamoxifen (TAM) alone, aromatase inhibitor (AI) alone, radiation treatment (RT) alone, RT + TAM, and RT + AI. Baseline recurrence rates were modeled using the NSABP B17 and RTOG 9804 trials for standard-risk and good-risk DCIS, respectively. Relative risk reductions and adverse event rates for each treatment strategy were derived from meta-analyses of large randomized trials.

Comprehensive sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of base-case results.\nRT alone was cost-effective for patients with standard-risk DCIS, and observation was cost-effective for patients with good-risk DCIS, across both age groups. Strategies including TAM or AI resulted in fewer quality-adjusted life-years than observation, because of the prolonged decrement in quality of life outweighing the modest benefit in ipsilateral risk reduction. In sensitivity analysis, RT alone was cost-effective for age 40, good-risk patients when ipsilateral risk reduction matched that of the RTOG 9804 trial, there was minimal increased risk of contralateral breast secondary malignancy, or there was strong patient willingness to pursue RT.\nOur findings suggest that cost-effective and clinically optimal treatment strategies are RT alone for standard-risk DCIS and observation for good-risk DCIS, with personalization on the basis of patient age and preference for RT.

In addition, the meta-level functional network connectivity (FNC) among the\u00a0DMN subnetworks after chemotherapy was consistently weaker than the baseline FNC as seen in the couplings between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and retrosplenial (rSplenia) region, with \u0394FNC('ACC','rSplenia')=-0.14, t value=-2.44, 95\u00a0%CI=[-0.27,-0.10], p", "journal": "Brain imaging and behavior", "date": "2021-05-22", "authors": ["Bihong TChen", "ZikuanChen", "Sunita KPatel", "Russell CRockne", "Chi WahWong", "James CRoot", "Andrew JSaykin", "Tim AAhles", "Andrei IHolodny", "Can-LanSun", "Mina SSedrak", "HeeyoungKim", "AshleyCelis", "VaniKatheria", "WilliamDale"], "doi": "10.1007/s11682-021-00475-y\n10.1002/pon.4564\n10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050817-084903\n10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050817-084903\n10.1038/nrc2073\n10.1103/PhysRevE.83.041906\n10.1016/j.nbd.2012.07.009\n10.1007/s10549-019-05230-y\n10.1007/s10549-018-4911-y\n10.1016/j.jgo.2019.09.016\n10.1371/journal.pone.0232548\n10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.03.008\n10.3389/fnins.2018.00015\n10.1186/alzrt106\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.077\n10.1073/pnas.0601417103\n10.1007/s11065-014-9249-6\n10.1093/jnci/djx285\n10.1007/s11682-013-9244-1\n10.1038/nrn2201\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182872e5f\n10.1093/jnci/djaa060\n10.1093/jnci/djz136\n10.1017/s1355617713001173\n10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.03.036\n10.3389/fnhum.2017.00555\n10.1073/pnas.1214551110\n10.1002/cncr.30208\n10.1053/j.seminoncol.2013.09.006\n10.1200/jco.18.00140\n10.1016/j.exger.2015.02.009\n10.3389/fnagi.2014.00301\n10.1016/j.bbi.2012.05.007\n10.1007/s00234-016-1708-8\n10.15252/emmm.202012075\n10.1146/annurev-psych-010418-103052\n10.1007/s11682-019-00038-2\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.025\n10.1073/pnas.98.2.676\n10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.085\n10.1523/jneurosci.3067-17.2018\n10.1016/s1470-2045(10)70294-1\n10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182872ded"}
{"title": "\"Real-world\" radiomics from multi-vendor MRI: an original retrospective study on the prediction of nodal status and disease survival in breast cancer, as an exemplar to promote discussion of the wider issues.", "abstract": "Most MRI radiomics studies to date, even multi-centre ones, have used \"pure\" datasets deliberately accrued from single-vendor, single-field-strength scanners. This does not reflect aspirations for the ultimate generalisability of AI models. We therefore investigated the development of a radiomics signature from heterogeneous data originating on six different imaging platforms, for a breast cancer exemplar, in order to provide input into future discussions of the viability of radiomics in \"real-world\" scenarios where image data are not controlled by specific trial protocols but reflective of routine clinical practice.\nOne hundred fifty-six patients with pathologically proven breast cancer underwent multi-contrast MRI prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or surgery. From these, 92 patients were identified for whom T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences were available, as well as key clinicopathological variables. Regions-of-interest were drawn on the above image types and, from these, semantic and calculated radiomics features were derived. Classification models using a variety of methods, both with and without recursive feature elimination, were developed to predict pathological nodal status. Separately, we applied the same methods to analyse the information carried by the radiomic features regarding the originating scanner type and field strength. Repeated, ten-fold cross-validation was employed to verify the results. In parallel work, survival modelling was performed using random survival forests.\nPrediction of nodal status yielded mean cross-validated AUC values of 0.735\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15 (SD) for clinical variables alone, 0.673\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16\u00a0(SD) for radiomic features only, and 0.764\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16 (SD) for radiomics and clinical features together. Prediction of scanner platform from the radiomics features yielded extremely high values of AUC between 0.91 and 1 for the different classes examined indicating the presence of confounding features for the nodal status classification task. Survival analysis, gave out-of-bag prediction errors of 19.3% (clinical features only), 36.9-51.8% (radiomic features from different combinations of image contrasts), and 26.7-35.6% (clinical plus radiomics features).\nRadiomic classification models whose predictive ability was consistent with previous single-vendor, single-field strength studies have been obtained from multi-vendor, multi-field-strength data, despite clear confounding information being present.

{"title": "Nanogenomics and Artificial Intelligence: A Dynamic Duo for the Fight Against Breast Cancer.", "abstract": "Application software is utilized to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Yet, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are addressing challenges related to the detection, classification, and monitoring of different types of tumors. AI can apply deep learning algorithms to perform automated analysis on mammographic or histologic examinations. Large volume of data generated by digitalized mammogram or whole-slide images can be interoperated through advanced machine learning. This enables fast evaluation of every tissue patch on an image, resulting in a quicker more sensitivity, and more reproducible diagnoses compared to human performance. On the other hand, cancer cell-exosomes which are extracellular vesicles released by cancer cells into the blood circulation, are being explored as cancer biomarker. Recent studies on cancer-exosome-content revealed that the encapsulated miRNA and other biomolecules are indicative of tumor sub-type, possible metastasis and prognosis. Thus, theoretically, through nanogenomicas, a profile of each breast tumor sub-type, estrogen receptor status, and potential metastasis site can be constructed. Then, a laboratory instrument, fitted with an AI program, can be used to diagnose suspected patients by matching their sera miRNA and biomolecules composition with the available template profiles. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of establishing a nanogenomics-AI-based breast cancer diagnostic approach, compared to the gold standard radiology or histology based approaches that are currently being adapted to AI.

Therefore, engineering hypoxia-sensitive cytotoxic and immunogenic nanomedicines would promote the therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we developed novel tumor-targeted polymeric micelles sensing hypoxia in tumors to activate strong cytotoxicity and immunogenic responses for effectively eradicating advanced breast cancer. The hypoxia-activatable polymeric micelles could efficiently deliver anticancer drugs and photosensitizers into cancer cells, to trigger synergistic cytotoxicity and immunogenic cell death through chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)/photothermal therapy (PTT). The long-circulating micelles efficiently delivered drugs to triple negative 4T1 breast tumors for accurate tumor diagnosis by photoacoustic imaging (PA), and effectively eliminating primary tumors without recurrence, including hypoxic 4T1 tumors. In addition, the micelle-based eradication of primary tumors could elicit robust systemic immune responses to inhibit tumor recurrence and significantly suppress distant 4T1 tumors and lung metastasis by combining with CpG and aCTLA4.

Their protective effects and MMP9 as well as VEGF protein expression levels (Western blotting) investigated in the 4T1 murine breast cancer model. Our results showed that both crocin and metformin reduced cell viability, delayed scratch healing and inhibited the cell adhesion, in vitro. While crocin alone restored the mice's weight reduction, crocin, metformin, and their combination significantly reduced the tumor volume size and enhanced animal survival rate in murine breast cancer model, responses that were associated with VEGF and MMP9 down-regulation.

It suppresses the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and promotes cytochrome-C/Apaf-1/caspase-9 activation to induce effective apoptosis. Because IAP inhibition has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation, we investigated the role of birinapant in radiosensitization of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Two glioblastoma cell lines, U-251 and U-87, were used to analyze radiosensitization in vitro with 7-AAD cell death/apoptosis and clonogenic assays. Subcutaneous flank (U-251 and U-87) and intracranial orthotopic (U-251) xenografts in nude mice were used to evaluate radiosensitization in vivo. TNF-\u03b1 levels in media and serum were measured using electrochemiluminescence. Radiosensitization in vitro was more prominent for U-251 cells than for U-87 cells. In vivo, in both tumor models, significant tumor growth delay was observed with combination treatment compared to radiation alone. There was a survival benefit with combination treatment in the orthotopic U-251 model. TNF-\u03b1 levels in media correlated directly with radiation dose in vitro. These findings show that birinapant can enhance the radiosensitivity of glioblastoma cell lines in cell-based assays and tumor models via radiation-induced TNF-\u03b1.

This cyclin CDK4/6 inhibitor could expose patients to a grade 3-4 hematological toxicity, leading to treatment discontinuation or treatment interruption that is potentially associated with a lack of efficiency. The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors of severe early hematotoxicity (ESHT).\nThis retrospective cohort study included patients who started palbociclib in the Institut Sainte Catherine between December 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Individual data and hematological toxicity were collected from electronic medical records. ESHT was defined as the occurrence, during the first 3 cycles, of grade 4 or grade 3 hematological toxicity requiring palbociclib dose reduction.\nIn total, 181 patients (180 females) were included; median age was 67 years. Forty-six patients (25.4%) experienced an ESHT. Predictive factors of ESHT in multivariate analysis were a performance status (PS) of 2 or more (P=0.024) and an history of radiotherapy of bone metastasis in the previous year (P=0.003).

FASN is essential for cancer cell survival and contributes to drug and radiation resistance by up-regulating DNA damage repair but not required for most non-lipogenic tissues. Thus, FASN is an attractive target for drug discovery. However, despite decades of effort in targeting FASN, no FASN inhibitors have been approved due to poor pharmacokinetics or toxicities. Here, we show that the FDA-approved proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) effectively inhibit FASN and suppress breast cancer cell survival. PPI inhibition of FASN leads to suppression of non-homologous end joining repair of DNA damages by reducing FASN-mediated PARP1 expression, resulting in apoptosis from oxidative DNA damages and sensitization of cellular resistance to doxorubicin and ionizing radiation. Mining electronic medical records of 6754 breast cancer patients showed that PPI usage significantly increased overall survival and reduced disease recurrence of these patients. Hence, PPIs may be repurposed as anticancer drugs for breast cancer treatments by targeting FASN to overcome drug and radiation resistance.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2021-04-05", "authors": ["Chao JWang", "DerenLi", "Jacob ADanielson", "Evan HZhang", "ZizhengDong", "Kathy DMiller", "LangLi", "Jian-TingZhang", "Jing-YuanLiu"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2021.03.026"}

The input consists of 6 channels including the patient CT along with binary masks for four OARs and one covering the volume receiving 95% dose (based on the clinical plan). A training set of 120 patients was compiled and used with 5-fold cross validation. The best performing model from the 5 folds was analyzed with a test set of 25 patients using cumulative DVH, mean differences in mean dose to OARs represented by box plots, and V20 of the left lung.\nWe have shown that both models are capable of producing clinically acceptable dose distributions, with the 3D outperforming the 2D model. The average dose difference for mean dose is within 0.02% of the dose prescription for both models. The V20 from the predicted dose distributions are comparable with the V20 from clinical plans, where predictions tend to be slightly under.\nBased on the results, the models could be implemented clinically to produce dose distributions that can be used as a reference to ensure the most ideal plan is used.

Its activation is associated with an exaggeration of cell proliferation with an increase in repair capacity resulting in increased radioresistance. On cardiac tissues, HER2 receptor activation plays a cardio-protective role. Trastuzumab, the first anti-HER2 drug used to treat patients with breast cancer overexpressing HER2 receptor , inhibits the cascade of reactions resulting in the proliferation of tumor cells, thus restoring cellular radiosensitivity. However, the combination of Trastuzumab with radiation therapy also removes HER2 receptor cardio-protective role on myocardial cells which increases the risk of cardiotoxicity. Thus, the concomitant association of these two modalities has long been a subject of controversy. Recent advances in radiation therapy technology and early detection of cardiac injury may limit the cardiotoxicity of this combination. Through this review, we developed the biological basis and the benefit-risk of concomitant combination of radiotherapy and Trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancers overexpressing HER2 and we discuss the modalities of its optimization.", "journal": "Bulletin du cancer", "date": "2021-03-23", "authors": ["NejlaFourati", "RimTrigui", "SelmaCharfeddine", "FatmaDhouib", "Wala BenKridis", "LeilaAbid", "AfefKhanfir", "WafaMnejja", "JamelDaoud"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bulcan.2020.12.012"}

The variability between tumour types regarding stroma fraction, and its prognosis associations, have not been systematically analysed.\nUsing an objective machine-learning method we quantified the tumour stroma in 16 solid cancer types from 2732 patients, representing retrospective tissue collections of surgically resected primary tumours. Image analysis performed tissue segmentation into stromal and epithelial compartment based on pan-cytokeratin staining and autofluorescence patterns.\nThe stroma fraction was highly variable within and across the tumour types, with kidney cancer showing the lowest and pancreato-biliary type periampullary cancer showing the highest stroma proportion (median 19% and 73% respectively). Adjusted Cox regression models revealed both positive (pancreato-biliary type periampullary cancer and oestrogen negative breast cancer, HR(95%CI)=0.56(0.34-0.92) and HR(95%CI)=0.41(0.17-0.98) respectively) and negative (intestinal type periampullary cancer, HR(95%CI)=3.59(1.49-8.62)) associations of the tumour stroma fraction with survival.\nOur study provides an objective quantification of the tumour stroma fraction across major types of solid cancer.

Ancillary testing, particularly androgen receptor (AR) positivity on immunohistochemistry, can be very helpful in cases that demonstrate extensive squamous morphology, since AR positivity is uncommon in both the primary salivary gland and metastatic squamous cell carcinomas to the parotid. In this report, we describe a case of salivary duct carcinoma that showed only a squamous cell carcinoma component on the initial primary tumor site biopsy, as well as in subsequent contralateral neck lymph node and skin metastases. Apart from the variable morphology, the typical salivary duct and squamous cell carcinoma tumor components also showed significant immunohistochemical differences, including differential staining of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu.

{"title": "Risk and prognostic factors of breast cancer with liver metastases.", "abstract": "Liver metastasis is a significant adverse predictor of overall survival (OS) among breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk and prognostic factors of breast cancer with liver metastases (BCLM).\nData on 311,573 breast cancer patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and 1728 BCLM patients from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) were included. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for liver metastasis. Cox proportional hazards regression model was adopted to determine independent prognostic factors in BCLM patients.\nYoung age, invasive ductal carcinoma, higher pathological grade, and subtype of triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) were risk factors for developing liver metastasis. The median OS after liver metastasis was 20.0\u2009months in the SEER database and 27.3\u2009months in the FUSCC dataset. Molecular subtypes also played a critical role in the survival of BCLM patients. We observed that hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2+ patients had the longest median OS (38.0 for SEER vs. 34.0\u2009months for FUSCC), whereas triple-negative breast cancer had the shortest OS (9.0 vs. 15.6\u2009months) in both SEER and FUSCC. According to the results from the FUSCC, the subtype of HR+/HER2+ (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20092.62; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.88-3.66; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and HR-/HER2+ (HR\u2009=\u20093.43; 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.28-5.15; P\u2009<\u20090.001) were associated with a significantly increased death risk in comparison with HR+/HER2- patients if these patients did not receive HER2-targeted therapy. For those who underwent HER2-targeted therapy, however, HR+/HER2+ subtype reduced death risk compared with HR+/HER2- subtype (HR\u2009=\u20090.74; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.58-0.95; P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nBreast cancer patients at a high risk for developing liver metastasis deserve more attention during the follow-up.

The system was trained using multi-center data (n\u2009=\u2009858) with manual heart segmentations provided by cardiovascular radiologists. Validation of the system was performed in an independent real-world dataset of 5677 breast cancer patients treated with radiation therapy at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center between 2008-2018. In a subset of 20 patients, the performance of the system was compared to eight radiation oncology experts by assessing segmentation time, agreement between experts, and accuracy with and without deep-learning assistance. To compare the performance to segmentations used in the clinic, concordance and failures (defined as Dice\u2009<\u20090.85) of the system were evaluated in the entire dataset. The system was successfully applied without retraining. With deep-learning assistance, segmentation time significantly decreased (4.0\u2009min [IQR 3.1-5.0] vs. 2.0\u2009min [IQR 1.3-3.5]; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and agreement increased (Dice 0.95 [IQR\u2009=\u20090.02]; vs. 0.97 [IQR\u2009=\u20090.02], p\u2009<\u20090.001).

The treatment strategies are diverse, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite multimodality treatment, the response rate is unsatisfactory. DNA repair and genetic instability are highly associated with carcinogenesis and treatment outcomes in oral squamous cell cancer, affecting cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, focusing on DNA repair and genetic instability interactions could be a potential target for improving the outcomes of OSCC patients. DNA polymerase-\u03b2 (POLB) is an important enzyme in base excision repair and contributes to gene instability, leading to tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis. The aim of our study was to confirm POLB regulates the growth of OSCC cells through modulation of cell cycle and chromosomal instability. We analyzed a tissue array from 133 OSCC patients and discovered that low POLB expression was associated with advanced tumor stage and poor overall survival. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, low POLB expression and advanced lymph node status were significantly associated with poor survival. By performing in vitro studies on model cell lines, we demonstrated that POLB silencing regulated cell cycles, exacerbated mitotic abnormalities and enhanced cell proliferation. After POLB depletion, OSCC cells showed chromosomal instability and aneuploidy.

{"title": "Clinical feasibility of deep learning-based auto-segmentation of target volumes and organs-at-risk in breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery.", "abstract": "In breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy (RT), accurate target delineation and reduction of radiation doses to the nearby normal organs is important. However, manual clinical target volume (CTV) and organs-at-risk (OARs) segmentation for treatment planning increases physicians' workload and inter-physician variability considerably. In this study, we evaluated the potential benefits of deep learning-based auto-segmented contours by comparing them to manually delineated contours for breast cancer patients.\nCTVs for bilateral breasts, regional lymph nodes, and OARs (including the heart, lungs, esophagus, spinal cord, and thyroid) were manually delineated on planning computed tomography scans of 111 breast cancer patients who received breast-conserving surgery. Subsequently, a two-stage convolutional neural network algorithm was used. Quantitative metrics, including the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff distance, and qualitative scoring by two panels from 10 institutions were used for analysis. Inter-observer variability and delineation time were assessed; furthermore, dose-volume histograms and dosimetric parameters were also analyzed using another set of patient data.\nThe correlation between the auto-segmented and manual contours was acceptable for OARs, with a mean DSC higher than 0.80 for all OARs. In addition, the CTVs showed favorable results, with mean DSCs higher than 0.70 for all breast and regional lymph node CTVs. Furthermore, qualitative subjective scoring showed that the results were acceptable for all CTVs and OARs, with a median score of at least 8 (possible range: 0-10) for (1) the differences between manual and auto-segmented contours and (2) the extent to which auto-segmentation would assist physicians in clinical practice. The differences in dosimetric parameters between the auto-segmented and manual contours were minimal.\nThe feasibility of deep learning-based auto-segmentation in breast RT planning was demonstrated.

To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment are a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is typically the gold standard, but it bears the burden of significant false negativity, adding to the urgent need of alternative diagnostic methods to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographic changes in CT images, this study hypothesized that artificial intelligence methods might be able to extract specific graphical features of COVID-19 and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control.\nWe collected 1065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation.\nThe internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with a specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with a specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images, the first two nucleic acid test results were negative, and 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with an accuracy of 85.2%.\nThese results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\u2022 The study evaluated the diagnostic performance of a deep learning algorithm using CT images to screen for COVID-19 during the influenza season. \u2022 As a screening method, our model achieved a relatively high sensitivity on internal and external CT image datasets. \u2022 The model was used to distinguish between COVID-19 and other typical viral pneumonia, both of which have quite similar radiologic characteristics.", "journal": "European radiology", "date": "2021-02-26", "authors": ["ShuaiWang", "BoKang", "JinluMa", "XianjunZeng", "MingmingXiao", "JiaGuo", "MengjiaoCai", "JingyiYang", "YaodongLi", "XiangfeiMeng", "BoXu"], "doi": "10.1007/s00330-021-07715-1\n10.1111/tmi.13383\n10.1007/s11517-019-01965-4\n10.1515/ijb-2018-0060\n10.14299/ijser.2020.03.02\n10.1089/omi.2018.0097"}

{"title": "Deep learning identifies morphological features in breast cancer predictive of cancer ERBB2 status and trastuzumab treatment efficacy.", "abstract": "The treatment of patients with ERBB2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer with anti-ERBB2 therapy is based on the detection of ERBB2 gene amplification or protein overexpression. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can predict the amplification of ERBB2 based on tumor morphological features, but it is not known whether ML-derived features can predict survival and efficacy of anti-ERBB2 treatment. In this study, we trained a deep learning model with digital images of hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)-stained formalin-fixed primary breast tumor tissue sections, weakly supervised by ERBB2 gene amplification status. The gene amplification was determined by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). The training data comprised digitized tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 1,047 patients. The correlation between the deep learning-predicted ERBB2 status, which we call H&E-ERBB2 score, and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was investigated on a fully independent test set, which included whole-slide tumor images from 712 patients with trastuzumab treatment status available. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in predicting gene amplification in the test sets was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.63-0.77) on 354 TMA samples and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.71) on 712 whole-slide images. Among patients with ERBB2-positive cancer treated with trastuzumab, those with a higher than the median morphology-based H&E-ERBB2 score derived from machine learning had more favorable DDFS than those with a lower score (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.93; P\u2009=\u20090.034).

{"title": "Inhibition of ATM Induces Hypersensitivity to Proton Irradiation by Upregulating Toxic End Joining.", "abstract": "Proton Bragg peak irradiation has a higher ionizing density than conventional photon irradiation or the entrance of the proton beam profile. Whether targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) could enhance vulnerability to the distinct pattern of damage induced by proton Bragg peak irradiation is currently unknown. Here, we performed genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of key DDR elements and evaluated DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and tumor control in cell lines and xenografts treated with the same physical dose across a radiotherapy linear energy transfer spectrum. Radiotherapy consisted of 6 MV photons and the entrance beam or Bragg peak of a 76.8 MeV spot scanning proton beam. More complex DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) induced by Bragg peak proton irradiation preferentially underwent resection and engaged homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Unexpectedly, the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor, AZD0156, but not an inhibitor of ATM and Rad3-related, rendered cells hypersensitive to more densely ionizing proton Bragg peak irradiation. ATM inhibition blocked resection and shunted more DSBs to processing by toxic ligation through nonhomologous end-joining, whereas loss of DNA ligation via XRCC4 or Lig4 knockdown rescued resection and abolished the enhanced Bragg peak cell killing. Proton Bragg peak monotherapy selectively sensitized cell lines and tumor xenografts with inherent HR defects, and the repair defect induced by ATM inhibitor coadministration showed enhanced efficacy in HR-proficient models. In summary, inherent defects in HR or administration of an ATM inhibitor in HR-proficient tumors selectively enhances the relative biological effectiveness of proton Bragg peak irradiation.

{"title": "Images Are Data: A Breast Imaging Perspective on a Contemporary Paradigm.", "abstract": "\u2002Considering radiological examinations not as mere images, but as a source of data, has become the key paradigm in the diagnostic imaging field. This change of perspective is particularly popular in breast imaging. It allows breast radiologists to apply algorithms derived from computer science, to realize innovative clinical applications, and to refine already established methods. In this context, the terminology \"imaging biomarker\", \"radiomics\", and \"artificial intelligence\" are of pivotal importance. These methods promise noninvasive, low-cost (e.\u200ag., in comparison to multigene arrays), and workflow-friendly (automated, only one examination, instantaneous results, etc.) delivery of clinically relevant information.\n\u2002This paper is designed as a narrative review on the previously mentioned paradigm. The focus is on key concepts in breast imaging and important buzzwords are explained. For all areas of breast imaging, exemplary studies and potential clinical use cases are discussed.\n\u2002Considering radiological examination as a source of data may optimize patient management by guiding individualized breast cancer diagnosis and oncologic treatment in the age of precision medicine.\n\u2002 \u00b7 In conventional breast imaging, examinations are interpreted based on patterns perceivable by visual inspection.. \u00b7 The radiomics paradigm treats breast images as a source of data, containing information beyond what is visible to our eyes.. \u00b7 This results in radiomic signatures that may be considered as imaging biomarkers, as they provide diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic information.. \u00b7 Radiomics derived imaging biomarkers may be used to individualize breast cancer treatment in the era of precision medicine.. \u00b7 The concept and key research of radiomics in the field of breast imaging will be discussed in this narrative review..\n\u00b7 Dietzel M, Clauser P, Kapetas P et\u200aal.

{"title": "MiRNA10b-directed nanotherapy effectively targets brain metastases from breast cancer.", "abstract": "RNA interference represents one of the most appealing therapeutic modalities for cancer because of its potency, versatility, and modularity. Because the mechanism is catalytic and affects the expression of disease-causing antigens at the post-transcriptional level, only small amounts of therapeutic need to be delivered to the target in order to exert a robust therapeutic effect. RNA interference is also advantageous over other treatment modalities, such as monoclonal antibodies or small molecules, because it has a much broader array of druggable targets. Finally, the complementarity of the genetic code gives us the opportunity to design RNAi therapeutics using computational, rational approaches. Previously, we developed and tested an RNAi-targeted therapeutic, termed MN-anti-miR10b, which was designed to inhibit the critical driver of metastasis and metastatic colonization, miRNA-10b. We showed in animal models of metastatic breast cancer that MN-anti-miR10b accumulated into tumors and metastases in the lymph nodes, lungs, and bone, following simple intravenous injection. We also found that treatment incorporating MN-anti-miR10b was effective at inhibiting the emergence of metastases and could regress already established metastases in the lymph nodes, lungs, and bone. In the present study, we extend the application of MN-anti-miR10b to a model of breast cancer metastatic to the brain. We demonstrate delivery to the metastatic lesions and obtain evidence of a therapeutic effect manifested as inhibition of metastatic progression.

We aim to determine if dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans made at the time of AI initiation are associated with decreased fractures. We retrospectively identified 25,158 women with local or regional breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2013 who received AI therapy between 2007 and 2013 from the Medicare-linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and Texas Cancer Registry databases. We defined baseline DXA screening using claims made between 1\u2009year before and 6\u2009months after each patient's first AI claim to examine determinants of baseline screening using a multivariable GENMOD model. We included a propensity score adjustment in Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association between time-varying DXA screening and the risk of fractures. Additionally, we compared the use of antiresorptive therapy drugs between the two groups. Of the study cohort, 14,738 (58.6%) received DXA screening. The screening rates increased annually from 52.1% in 2007 to 61.7% in 2013. Higher screening rates were observed in patients with younger age, married status, non-Hispanic white race, localized disease, fewer comorbidities, more than one type of aromatase inhibitor drug claim, no state buy-in (surrogate for low socioeconomic status), higher education level, and prior osteoporosis diagnosis. Baseline DXA screening was associated with decreased risk of subsequent fractures (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.97, p\u2009<\u2009.001) after multivariable and propensity score adjustment.

{"title": "Breast Cancer Response to Therapy: Can microRNAs Lead the Way?", "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of death among women with malignant diseases. The selection of adequate therapies for highly invasive and metastatic BCs still represents a major challenge. Novel combinatorial therapeutic approaches are urgently required to enhance the efficiency of BC treatment. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) emerged as key regulators of the complex mechanisms that govern BC therapeutic resistance and susceptibility. In the present review we aim to critically examine how miRNAs influence BC response to therapies, or how to use miRNAs as a basis for new therapeutic approaches. We summarized recent findings in this rapidly evolving field, emphasizing the challenges still ahead for the successful implementation of miRNAs into BC treatment while providing insights for future BC management.The goal of this review was to propose miRNAs, that might simultaneously improve the efficacy of all four therapies that are the backbone of current BC management (radio-, chemo-, targeted, and hormone therapy). Among the described miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-16 emerged as the most promising, closely followed by miR-205, miR-451, miR-182, and miRNAs from the let-7 family. miR-21 inhibition might be the best choice for future improvement of invasive BC treatment.New therapeutic strategies of miRNA-based agents alongside current standard treatment modalities could greatly benefit BC patients.

The generated CBCT images from the Cycle-Deblur GAN model demonstrated closer CT values to FBCT in the lung, breast, mediastinum, and sternum compared to the CycleGAN and RED-CNN models.

Mice received either HIFU alone or were primed with the toll-like receptor 9 agonist CpG and the checkpoint modulator anti-PD-1. Both mechanical HIFU and thermal ablation induced a potent inflammatory response with increased expression of Nlrp3, Jun, Mefv, Il6 and Il1\u03b2 and alterations in macrophage polarization compared to control. Furthermore, HIFU upregulated multiple innate immune receptors and immune pathways, including Nod1, Nlrp3, Aim2, Ctsb, Tlr1/2/4/7/8/9, Oas2, and RhoA. The inflammatory response was largely sterile and consistent with wound-healing.

{"title": "Automatic segmentation of three clinical target volumes in radiotherapy using lifelong learning.", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have comparable human level performance in automatic segmentation. An important challenge that CNNs face in segmentation is catastrophic forgetting. They lose performance on tasks that were previously learned when trained on task. In this study, we propose a lifelong learning method to learn multiple segmentation tasks continuously without forgetting previous tasks.\nThe cohort included three tumors, 800 patients of which had nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), 800 patients had breast cancer, and 800 patients had rectal cancer. The tasks included segmentation of the clinical target volume (CTV) of these three cancers. The proposed lifelong learning network adopted dilation adapter to learn three segmentation tasks one by one. Only the newly added dilation adapter (seven layers) was fine tuning for incoming new task, whereas all the other learned layers were frozen.\nCompared with single-task, multi-task or transfer learning, the proposed lifelong learning can achieve better or comparable segmentation accuracy with a DSC of 0.86 for NPC, 0.89 for breast cancer, and 0.87 for rectal cancer. Lifelong learning can avoid forgetting in sequential learning and yield good performance with less training data. Furthermore, it is more efficient than single-task or transfer learning, which reduced the number of parameters, size of model, and training time by ~58.8%, ~55.6%, and ~25.0%, respectively.\nThe proposed method preserved the knowledge of previous tasks while learning a new one using a dilation adapter.

Thanks to the development of target therapies, HER2 positive patients can be managed using HER2-targeting drugs. There are several kinds ofHER2 inhibitors, such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and pyrotinib. Pyrotinib which exert different functions, of note, the latest generation of the drug, is an irreversible small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (HER1) and/or HER2\u200aand/or HER4. Both lapatinib and pyrotinib potentially target EGFR and/or HER2, but in some instances, induces different responses of patients with EGFR and/or HER2 mutations. This is attributed to the different mutations in EGFR and HER2 genes, which may form distinct types of HER2 dimers, with different binding capacities to drugs.\nFive years ago, a patient underwent a radical mastectomy in an external hospital. Results of the resection histopathology revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma, pT3N0M0, stage IIB, HER2 positive. The lady patient received 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and was subjected to adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for 1 year. After a regular 1-year follow-up and in March 2018, she complained of chest pain and visited our hospital. We diagnosed her with metastatic breast cancer, positive for HER2.\npositron emission tomography/computed tomography showed multiple metastases in the lung and sternum, while the breast lesions did not progress, the curative effect of which we evaluated as a progressive disease. Then, lapatinib integrated with chemotherapy was administered to the patient. After 5 cycles of the treatment, the patient experienced lower back pain. Through CT examination, it was revealed that she had multiple metastases in the lung and sternum, in addition to new metastases in the lumbar spine and right lobe of the liver. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple metastases in the brain, and the disease further progressed. The results of circulating tumor DNA assays showed that other than HER2 amplification, novel EGFR-ZNF880 fusion and EGFR E114K mutations developed.\nThe patient was administered with a combination of pyrotinib with chemotherapy.\nAfter 2 months of pyrotinib treatment, the metastases of the lung, sternum, lumbar spine, and right lobe of the liver disappeared. Also, the size of the brain metastases reduced while bone metastases were relieved. The curative effect was evaluated as a partial response. Following the results of circulating tumor DNA assays, HER2 amplification, EGFR-ZNF880 fusion, and EGFR E114K mutations disappeared. However, since a small lesion was present in the brain, the patient was subjected to radiotherapy in the head. Notably, after 9 months treatment with pyrotinib, enhanced CT indicated that tumors in the breast, liver, both lungs, brain, and bone were under control. The patient continually received oral pyrotinib, however, a new brain lesion appeared 6 months later. Overall, we managed to regulate the efficacy of pyrotinib for up to 15 months.\nThis case report demonstrates that EGFR-ZNF880 fusion and EGFR E114K mutations may contribute or lead to the formation of a special HER2 dimer, which is rapidly resistant to lapatinib but sensitive to pyrotinib.

Growing evidence has indicated that peptidyl arginine deiminase-4 (PAD4) inhibitor can alleviate the development of multiple cancers, including breast cancer, through inhibiting cell proliferation. GSK484 is considered to be a highly potent PAD4-selective inhibitors. However, the potential role and mechanism of GSK484 in TNBC remain unclear. In this study, we intended to explore the effects of GSK484 on the radiosensitivity of TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549). We found that the pretreatment of GSK484 enhanced irradiation (IR)-induced inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Besides, our findings revealed that GSK484 facilitated TNBC cell apoptosis. IR treatment-induced increase of the protein level of ATG5 and ATG7, and decrease of p62 protein level were countervailed by GSK484. In addition, GSK484 enhanced DNA damage induced by IR. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combined treatment of IR and GSK484 showed an obvious decline of tumor growth in contrast to IR-alone or GSK484-alone treatment. Overall, GSK484 may serve as a radiosensitizer of TNBC through inhibiting IR-induced autophagy.", "journal": "Human & experimental toxicology", "date": "2020-12-24", "authors": ["LiningWei", "XiangpingWang", "MinLuo", "HongzhiWang", "HaoChen", "ChangjieHuang"], "doi": "10.1177/0960327120979028"}
{"title": "SAP-cGAN: Adversarial learning for breast mass segmentation in digital mammogram based on superpixel average pooling.", "abstract": "Breast mass segmentation is a prerequisite step in the use of computer-aided tools designed for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. However, mass segmentation remains challenging due to the low contrast, irregular shapes, and fuzzy boundaries of masses. In this work, we propose a mammography mass segmentation model for improving segmentation performance.\nWe propose a mammography mass segmentation model called SAP-cGAN, which is based on an improved conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We introduce a superpixel average pooling layer into the cGAN decoder, which utilizes superpixels as a pooling layout to improve boundary segmentation. In addition, we adopt a multiscale input strategy to enable the network to learn scale-invariant features with increased robustness. The performance of the model is evaluated with two public datasets: CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. Moreover, ablation analysis is conducted to evaluate further the individual contribution of each block to the performance of the network.\nDice and Jaccard scores of 93.37% and 87.57%, respectively, are obtained for the CBIS-DDSM dataset. The Dice and Jaccard scores for the INbreast dataset are 91.54% and 84.40%, respectively. These results indicate that our proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art breast mass segmentation methods. The superpixel average pooling layer and multiscale input strategy has improved the Dice and Jaccard scores of the original cGAN by 7.8% and 12.79%, respectively.\nAdversarial learning with the addition of a superpixel average pooling layer and multiscale input strategy can encourage the Generator network to generate masks with increased realism and improve breast mass segmentation performance through the minimax game between the Generator network and Discriminator network.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2020-12-20", "authors": ["YameiLi", "GuohuaZhao", "QianZhang", "YusongLin", "MeiyunWang"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.14671"}
{"title": "Selective glutamine metabolism inhibition in tumor cells improves antitumor T lymphocyte activity in triple-negative breast cancer.", "abstract": "Rapidly proliferating tumor and immune cells need metabolic programs that support energy and biomass production. The amino acid glutamine is consumed by effector T cells and glutamine-addicted triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, suggesting that a metabolic competition for glutamine may exist within the tumor microenvironment, potentially serving as a therapeutic intervention strategy. Here, we report that there is an inverse correlation between glutamine metabolic genes and markers of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in human basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) patient data sets, with increased glutamine metabolism and decreased T cell cytotoxicity associated with poor survival. We found that tumor cell-specific loss of glutaminase (GLS), a key enzyme for glutamine metabolism, improved antitumor T cell activation in both a spontaneous mouse TNBC model and orthotopic grafts. The glutamine transporter inhibitor V-9302 selectively blocked glutamine uptake by TNBC cells but not CD8+ T cells, driving synthesis of glutathione, a major cellular antioxidant, to improve CD8+ T cell effector function. We propose a \"glutamine steal\" scenario, in which cancer cells deprive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of needed glutamine, thus impairing antitumor immune responses. Therefore, tumor-selective targeting of glutamine metabolism may be a promising therapeutic strategy in TNBC.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "date": "2020-12-16", "authors": ["Deanna NEdwards", "Verra MNgwa", "Ariel LRaybuck", "ShanWang", "YoonhaHwang", "Laura CKim", "Sung HoonCho", "YeeunPaik", "QingfeiWang", "SiyuanZhang", "H CharlesManning", "Jeffrey CRathmell", "Rebecca SCook", "Mark RBoothby", "JinChen"], "doi": "10.1172/JCI140100\n10.1016/j.tibs.2010.05.003\n10.1172/JCI69600\n10.1016/j.it.2014.12.004\n10.1126/scisignal.aan4667\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0847\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0617\n10.1038/nrc.2016.84\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1016/j.cmet.2018.04.012\n10.15252/embj.201696151\n10.1038/s41573-019-0016-5\n10.1016/j.drudis.2016.12.003\n10.1038/nrc.2016.71\n10.1371/journal.pone.0185092\n10.1530/ERC-12-0398\n10.1038/onc.2015.381\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.08.009\n10.1084/jem.20151159\n10.4049/jimmunol.0903586\n10.1038/ni.2556\n10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.034\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.04.007\n10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.001\n10.1126/scisignal.aab2610\n10.1016/j.it.2015.02.007\n10.1016/j.trecan.2017.01.005\n10.1038/s41577-019-0140-9\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.016\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.012\n10.1002/ijc.23518\n10.1242/dmm.017830\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90030-G\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203280\n10.1186/gb-2007-8-5-r76\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-1515\n10.1093/nar/25.21.4323\n10.1016/0092-8674(94)90376-X\n10.1038/jcbfm.2014.129\n10.1172/JCI118043\n10.1093/jn/129.8.1524\n10.1002/eji.1830211136\n10.1016/0092-8674(94)90169-4\n10.1093/intimm/4.8.861\n10.1038/nm.4464\n10.1172/JCI91190\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.06.016\n10.1073/pnas.1720948115\n10.1073/pnas.0503726102\n10.1073/pnas.0307298101\n10.1016/j.immuni.2009.04.014\n10.1248/bpb.31.1096\n10.1074/jbc.274.34.23740\n10.1186/s12916-019-1326-5\n10.7150/jca.17648\n10.1242/jcs.116392\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.07.054\n10.1016/j.tcb.2017.10.010\n10.1038/ni.3796\n10.1172/JCI131859\n10.1038/s41467-018-05854-6\n10.1111/cas.13827\n10.1016/j.chom.2015.09.003\n10.1126/science.aav2588\n10.1152/ajpheart.00327.2002\n10.4049/jimmunol.167.11.6497\n10.1038/s41587-020-0546-8\n10.1038/nature11412\n10.1038/s41598-018-27521-y"}
{"title": "Dichloroacetate Radiosensitizes Hypoxic Breast Cancer Cells.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism is an attractive target for cancer therapy. Reprogramming metabolic pathways can potentially sensitize tumors with limited treatment options, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), to chemo- and/or radiotherapy. Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a specific inhibitor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), which leads to enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS are the primary effector molecules of radiation and an increase hereof will enhance the radioresponse. In this study, we evaluated the effects of DCA and radiotherapy on two TNBC cell lines, namely EMT6 and 4T1, under aerobic and hypoxic conditions. As expected, DCA treatment decreased phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and lowered both extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and lactate production. Remarkably, DCA treatment led to a significant increase in ROS production (up to 15-fold) in hypoxic cancer cells but not in aerobic cells. Consistently, DCA radiosensitized hypoxic tumor cells and 3D spheroids while leaving the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the tumor cells unchanged. Our results suggest that although described as an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-promoting drug, DCA can also increase hypoxic radioresponses. This study therefore paves the way for the targeting of mitochondrial metabolism of hypoxic cancer cells, in particular to combat radioresistance.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-12-16", "authors": ["Svende Mey", "In\u00e8sDufait", "HengJiang", "CyrilCorbet", "HuiWang", "MelissaVan De Gucht", "LisaKerkhove", "Ka LunLaw", "HugoVandenplas", "ThierryGevaert", "OlivierFeron", "MarkDe Ridder"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21249367\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2016.66\n10.1016/j.soc.2017.08.005\n10.1016/j.breast.2015.07.008\n10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30932-6\n10.1186/s13058-017-0870-1\n10.1016/j.ejca.2017.06.014\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.09.041\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.03.007\n10.1007/s00066-010-2143-0\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.07.2332\n10.1259/0007-1285-26-312-638\n10.1038/nrc1367\n10.3390/cancers11010112\n10.1113/expphysiol.2006.033506\n10.1074/jbc.M001914200\n10.1038/s41598-017-15474-7\n10.1182/blood.V118.21.4998.4998\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1126/science.123.3191.309\n10.1186/1741-7015-7-68\n10.3892/ol.2016.4600\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1674\n10.1016/j.radonc.2014.07.015\n10.1016/j.radonc.2009.11.007\n10.1016/j.cmet.2006.02.002\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2014.08.005\n10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.10.018\n10.1155/2019/8201079\n10.1002/pros.20788\n10.18632/oncotarget.11906\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0247\n10.1007/s00066-013-0354-x\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0095\n10.1126/scisignal.2004088\n10.1038/bjc.2014.604\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605450\n10.7150/ijbs.13325\n10.1186/s13046-018-0758-7\n10.1093/jnci/djx071\n10.1002/ijc.29564\n10.1042/bj3580069\n10.1016/j.cmet.2016.07.003\n10.1126/science.1160809\n10.1016/j.ccr.2006.10.020\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0063\n10.18632/genesandcancer.26\n10.3389/fonc.2020.00428\n10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.05.050\n10.14791/btrt.2013.1.2.57\n10.1002/ijc.25599\n10.3892/ijo.2012.1687\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604356\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0930\n10.1038/bjc.2012.559\n10.1038/bjc.2012.527\n10.1016/j.canlet.2015.11.023\n10.1016/j.cmet.2015.08.007\n10.1074/jbc.M801765200\n10.1007/s13402-014-0212-6\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.08.006\n10.1371/journal.pone.0176162\n10.1038/nrc3803\n10.1016/j.jbo.2016.03.001\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-0530\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1755\n10.4103/0973-1482.55137\n10.1016/0360-3016(89)90298-8\n10.1016/j.bbcan.2016.08.001\n10.1124/mol.105.018911\n10.1016/j.bcp.2009.01.017\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604554\n10.1016/0026-0495(89)90051-6\n10.1042/bj1480085\n10.1021/cb400944y\n10.4161/15384047.2014.955992\n10.1038/onc.2012.198\n10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.12.009\n10.1186/s12943-017-0667-y\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0979\n10.18632/oncotarget.16991\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1868\n10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00184\n10.1038/s42003-018-0111-x\n10.1016/j.mehy.2018.11.012\n10.1093/toxsci/kfy272\n10.18632/oncotarget.3629\n10.1007/s10637-013-0047-4\n10.1126/scitranslmed.3000677\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.07.1381\n10.18632/oncotarget.16113\n10.3389/fphar.2018.01073\n10.18632/oncotarget.11635\n10.18632/oncotarget.6426"}

{"title": "Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of breast cancer MCF-7 / Taxol cells with MeDIP-Seq.", "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed tumor in women worldwide. Although the combination of surgery and Taxol chemotherapy can achieve a certain therapeutic effect, patients often develop drug-resistance, resulting in a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is significative to seek the molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance. Recent studies have found that abnormal epigenetic regulation in breast cells changes the expression of key genes, which can lead to the occurrence, development, and maintenance of cancer, even related to the development of drug-resistance. Therefore, in this study, we performed methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-seq) to reveal the difference in methylation between breast cancer drug-resistant cells and sensitive cells.

{"title": "Loss of HER2 and decreased T-DM1 efficacy in HER2 positive advanced breast cancer treated with dual HER2 blockade: the SePHER Study.", "abstract": "HER2-targeting agents have dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape of HER2+ advanced breast cancer (ABC). Within a short time frame, the rapid introduction of new therapeutics has led to the approval of pertuzumab combined with trastuzumab and a taxane in first-line, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in second-line. Thereby, evidence of T-DM1 efficacy following trastuzumab/pertuzumab combination is limited, with data from some retrospective reports suggesting lower activity. The purpose of the present study is to investigate T-DM1 efficacy in pertuzumab-pretreated and pertuzumab na\u00efve HER2 positive ABC patients. We also aimed to provide evidence on the exposure to different drugs sequences including pertuzumab and T-DM1 in HER2 positive cell lines.\nThe biology of HER2 was investigated in vitro through sequential exposure of resistant HER2\u2009+\u2009breast cancer cell lines to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and their combination. In vitro experiments were paralleled by the analysis of data from 555 HER2\u2009+\u2009ABC patients treated with T-DM1 and evaluation of T-DM1 efficacy in the 371 patients who received it in second line. Survival estimates were graphically displayed in Kaplan Meier curves, compared by log rank test and, when possibile, confirmed in multivariate models.\nWe herein show evidence of lower activity of T-DM1 in two HER2+ breast cancer cell lines resistant to trastuzumab+pertuzumab, as compared to trastuzumab-resistant cells. Lower T-DM1 efficacy was associated with a marked reduction of HER2 expression on the cell membrane and its nuclear translocation. HER2 downregulation at the membrane level was confirmed in biopsies of four trastuzumab/pertuzumab-pretreated patients. Among the 371 patients treated with second-line T-DM1, median overall survival (mOS) from diagnosis of advanced disease and median progression-free survival to second-line treatment (mPFS2) were 52 and 6\u2009months in 177 patients who received trastuzumab/pertuzumab in first-line, and 74 and 10\u2009months in 194 pertuzumab-na\u00efve patients (p\u2009=\u20090.0006 and 0.03 for OS and PFS2, respectively).\nOur data support the hypothesis that the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab reduces the amount of available plasma membrane HER2 receptor, limiting the binding of T-DM1 in cancer cells. This may help interpret the less favorable outcomes of second-line T-DM1 in trastuzumab/pertuzumab pre-treated patients compared to their pertuzumab-na\u00efve counterpart.", "journal": "Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR", "date": "2020-12-12", "authors": ["GiuliaBon", "LauraPizzuti", "ValentinaLaquintana", "RossellaLoria", "ManuelaPorru", "CaterinaMarchi\u00f2", "EriseldKrasniqi", "MaddalenaBarba", "MarcelloMaugeri-Sacc\u00e0", "TeresaGamucci", "RossanaBerardi", "LorenzoLivi", "CorradoFicorella", "ClaraNatoli", "EnricoCortesi", "DanieleGenerali", "NiclaLa Verde", "AlessandraCassano", "EmilioBria", "LucaMoscetti", "AndreaMichelotti", "VincenzoAdamo", "ClaudioZamagni", "GiuseppeTonini", "GiacomoBarchiesi", "MarcoMazzotta", "DanieleMarinelli", "SilverioTomao", "PaoloMarchetti", "Maria RosariaValerio", "RosannaMirabelli", "AntonioRusso", "Maria AgneseFabbri", "NicolaD'Ostilio", "EnzoVeltri", "DomenicoCorsi", "OrnellaGarrone", "IdaParis", "GiuseppinaSarobba", "FrancescoGiotta", "CarloGarufi", "MarinaCazzaniga", "PietroDel Medico", "MarioRoselli", "GiuseppeSanguineti", "IsabellaSperduti", "AnnaSapino", "RuggeroDe Maria", "CarloLeonetti", "AngeloDi Leo", "GennaroCiliberto", "RitaFalcioni", "PatriziaVici"], "doi": "10.1186/s13046-020-01797-3\n10.1200/JCO.2008.19.9844\n10.1056/NEJM200103153441101\n10.1200/JCO.2005.04.173\n10.1056/NEJMoa064320\n10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70130-X\n10.1056/NEJMoa1209124\n10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30313-3\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4597\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1776\n10.1007/s10549-010-1090-x\n10.1186/bcr3621\n10.1021/ar700108g\n10.18632/oncotarget.18176\n10.1200/JCO.2016.67.3624\n10.1091/mbc.e03-08-0596\n10.4161/cbt.6.12.4979\n10.3390/ph5070674\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-3856\n10.1016/j.ccr.2004.07.012\n10.1186/1471-2407-12-74\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-3127\n10.1111/cas.13761\n10.21037/cco.2017.10.08\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0358\n10.1186/bcr3637\n10.1038/onc.2014.272\n10.1007/s12282-019-00949-4"}

{"title": "Integrated imaging and molecular analysis to decipher tumor microenvironment in the era of immunotherapy.", "abstract": "Radiological imaging is an integral component of cancer care, including diagnosis, staging, and treatment response monitoring. It contains rich information about tumor phenotypes that are governed not only by cancer cellintrinsic biological processes but also by the tumor microenvironment, such as the composition and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. By analyzing the radiological scans using a quantitative radiomics approach, robust relations between specific imaging and molecular phenotypes can be established. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of radiogenomics for predicting intrinsic molecular subtypes and gene expression signatures in breast cancer based on MRI. In parallel, promising results have been shown for inferring the amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a key factor for the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, from standard-of-care radiological images. Compared with the biopsy-based approach, radiogenomics offers a unique avenue to profile the molecular makeup of the tumor and immune microenvironment as well as its evolution in a noninvasive and holistic manner through longitudinal imaging scans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the state of the art radiogenomics studies in the era of immunotherapy and discuss emerging paradigms and opportunities in AI and deep learning approaches. These technical advances are expected to transform the radiogenomics field, leading to the discovery of reliable imaging biomarkers.

PET/CT and MRI parameters were evaluated before and after the first NAC cycle in patients with advanced breast cancer [n\u2009=\u200956; all women; median age, 49 (range 26-66) years]. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained with the corresponding baseline values (SUV0, MTV0, and TLG0, respectively) and interim PET images (SUV1, MTV1, and TLG1, respectively).

The differences between the baseline and interim parameters were measured (\u0394SUV, \u0394MTV, \u0394TLG, and \u0394ADC). Subgroup analysis was performed for the HER2-negative and triple-negative groups.

{"title": "Combined 3-O-acetylbetulin treatment and carbonic anhydrase IX inhibition results in additive effects on human breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Hypoxia plays a key role in tumor progression and resistance to radiotherapy. Expression of the transmembrane-tethered enzyme carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is strongly induced by hypoxia. High CA IX expression levels correlate with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Previously, we showed that the downregulation of CA IX expression by siRNA interference and the inhibition of CA IX activity results in increased cytotoxicity, inhibition of migration and radiosensitization of hypoxic cancer cells. Betulinic acid (BA) is a natural compound derived from birch bark. It has shown promising anti-tumor effects due to its cancer cell specific cytotoxic properties. We have shown that BA inhibits the HIF-1\u03b1 pathway, resulting in apoptosis, inhibition of migration and enhanced cytotoxicity of breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigate the effects of the novel betulin derivative 3-O-acetylbetulin (3-AC) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI) octyl disulfamate (OCT) or 4-(3-[4-fluorophenyl]ureido)benzenesulfonamide (SLC-0111), on cellular and radiobiological parameters in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7\u00a0cells. Treatment with 3-AC or OCT alone only caused moderate cytotoxicity, reduction in cell migration, ROS production and DNA damage. However, the combined treatment with 3-AC and CAI strongly enhanced radiosensitivity, increased cytotoxicity, inhibited cell motility and enhanced DNA damage. Our findings suggest that the combination of two bioactive drugs 3-AC and a CAI, such as OCT or SLC-0111, could be a promising therapeutic approach for targeting hypoxic tumor cells.", "journal": "Chemico-biological interactions", "date": "2020-11-28", "authors": ["MarinaPetrenko", "AntjeG\u00fcttler", "AnneFuntan", "JacquelineKe\u00dfler", "DanielEmmerich", "ReinhardPaschke", "DirkVordermark", "MatthiasBache"], "doi": "10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109326"}

Here, we investigated the alternative therapeutic efficacy of novel combination treatment with necroptosis-inducing small molecules to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance in tyrosine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS)-positive breast cancer.\nPre-chemotherapeutic needle biopsy of 143 invasive ductal carcinomas undergoing the same chemotherapeutic regimen was subjected to proteomic analysis. Four different machine learning algorithms were employed to determine signature protein combinations. Immunoreactive markers were selected using three common candidate proteins from the machine-learning algorithms and verified by immunohistochemistry using 123 cases of independent needle biopsy FFPE samples. The regulation of chemotherapeutic response and necroptotic cell death was assessed using lentiviral YARS overexpression and depletion 3D spheroid formation assay, viability assays, LDH release assay, flow cytometry analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. The ROS-induced metabolic dysregulation and phosphorylation of necrosome complex by YARS were assessed using oxygen consumption rate analysis, flow cytometry analysis, and 3D cell viability assay. The therapeutic roles of SMAC mimetics (LCL161) and a pan-BCL2 inhibitor (ABT-263) were determined by 3D cell viability assay and flow cytometry analysis. Additional biologic process and protein-protein interaction pathway analysis were performed using Gene Ontology annotation and Cytoscape databases.\nYARS was selected as a potential biomarker by proteomics-based machine-learning algorithms and was exclusively associated with good response to chemotherapy by subsequent immunohistochemical validation. In 3D spheroid models of breast cancer cell lines, YARS overexpression significantly improved chemotherapy response via phosphorylation of the necrosome complex. YARS-induced necroptosis sequentially mediated mitochondrial dysfunction through the overproduction of ROS in breast cancer cell lines. Combination treatment with necroptosis-inducing small molecules, including a SMAC mimetic (LCL161) and a pan-BCL2 inhibitor (ABT-263), showed therapeutic efficacy in YARS-overexpressing breast cancer cells.\nOur results indicate that, before chemotherapy, an initial screening of YARS protein expression should be performed, and YARS-positive breast cancer patients might consider the combined treatment with LCL161 and ABT-263; this could be a novel stepwise clinical approach to apply new targeted therapy in breast cancer patients in the future.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2020-11-27", "authors": ["Kyung-MinLee", "HyebinLee", "DohyunHan", "Woo KyungMoon", "KwangsooKim", "Hyeon JeongOh", "JinwooChoi", "Eun HyeHwang", "Seong EunKang", "Seock-AhIm", "Kyung-HunLee", "Han SukRyu"], "doi": "10.1186/s13058-020-01367-7\n10.1056/NEJMoa1804710\n10.1073/pnas.1200194109\n10.1038/nrc3124\n10.1038/nrm2970\n10.1016/j.cell.2009.05.037\n10.1038/cdd.2016.8\n10.1038/s41420-019-0230-2\n10.1038/cdd.2017.183\n10.1038/nmeth.1322\n10.1038/nprot.2016.136\n10.1021/pr101065j\n10.1038/nature10098\n10.1038/nmeth.3901\n10.1074/mcp.M115.050245\n10.1200/JCO.2003.11.069\n10.1007/s10549-014-3051-2\n10.1186/1471-2105-8-392\n10.1101/gr.1239303\n10.1038/nbt.2839\n10.1074/mcp.O113.037200\n10.1038/17135\n10.1038/s41583-018-0091-3\n10.1038/ncomms14329\n10.1016/j.immuni.2013.02.003\n10.1016/j.molcel.2014.09.006\n10.1242/jcs.152470\n10.1038/cdd.2014.126\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4401545\n10.1038/nrd3627\n10.1182/bloodadvances.2018018168\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-16-0763\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3090"}

Early detection of breast cancer, followed by appropriate treatment, can reduce the risk of death from this disease. DL through CNN can assist imaging specialists in classifying the mammograms accurately. Accurate classification of mammograms using CNN needs a well-trained CNN by a large number of labeled mammograms. Unfortunately, a large number of labeled mammograms are not always available. In this study, a novel procedure to aid imaging specialists in detecting normal and abnormal mammograms has been proposed. The procedure supplied the designed CNN with a cheat sheet for some classical attributes extracted from the ROI and an extra number of labeled mammograms through data augmentation. The cheat sheet aided the CNN through encoding easy-to-recognize artificial patterns in the mammogram before passing it to the CNN, and the data augmentation supported the CNN with more labeled data points. Fifteen runs of 4 different modified datasets taken from the MIAS dataset were conducted and analyzed. The results showed that the cheat sheet, along with data augmentation, enhanced CNN's accuracy by at least 12.2% and enhanced the precision of the CNN by at least 2.2.

{"title": "Data-driven dose calculation algorithm based on deep U-Net.", "abstract": "Accurate and efficient dose calculation is an important prerequisite to ensure the success of radiation therapy. However, all the dose calculation algorithms commonly used in current clinical practice have to compromise between calculation accuracy and efficiency, which may result in unsatisfactory dose accuracy or highly intensive computation time in many clinical situations. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel dose calculation algorithm based on the deep learning method for radiation therapy. In this study we performed a feasibility investigation on implementing a fast and accurate dose calculation based on a deep learning technique. A two-dimensional (2D) fluence map was first converted into a three-dimensional (3D) volume using ray traversal algorithm. 3D U-Net like deep residual network was then established to learn a mapping between this converted 3D volume, CT and 3D dose distribution. Therefore an indirect relationship was built between a fluence map and its corresponding 3D dose distribution without using significantly complex neural networks. Two hundred patients, including nasopharyngeal, lung, rectum and breast cancer cases, were collected and applied to train the proposed network. Additional 47 patients were randomly selected to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method through comparing dose distributions, dose volume histograms and clinical indices with the results from a treatment planning system (TPS), which was used as the ground truth in this study. The proposed deep learning based dose calculation algorithm achieved good predictive performance. For 47 tested patients, the average per-voxel bias of the deep learning calculated value and standard deviation (normalized to the prescription), relative to the TPS calculation, is 0.17%\u00b12.28%. The average deep learning calculated values and standard deviations for relevant clinical indices were compared with the TPS calculated results and the t-test p-values demonstrated the consistency between them. In this study we developed a new deep learning based dose calculation method. This approach was evaluated by the clinical cases with different sites. Our results demonstrated its feasibility and reliability and indicated its great potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of radiation dose calculation for different treatment modalities.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2020-11-13", "authors": ["JiaweiFan", "LeiXing", "PengDong", "JiazhouWang", "WeigangHu", "YongYang"], "doi": "10.1088/1361-6560/abca05"}
{"title": "A six-gene-based signature for breast cancer radiotherapy sensitivity estimation.", "abstract": "Breast cancer (BRCA) represents the most common malignancy among women worldwide with high mortality. Radiotherapy is a prevalent therapeutic for BRCA that with heterogeneous effectiveness among patients. Here, we proposed to develop a gene expression-based signature for BRCA radiotherapy sensitivity estimation. Gene expression profiles of BRCA samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) were obtained and used as training and independent testing dataset, respectively. Differential expression genes (DEGs) in BRCA samples compared with their paracancerous samples in the training set were identified by using the edgeR Bioconductor package. Univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO Cox regression method were applied to screen optimal genes for constructing a radiotherapy sensitivity estimation signature. Nomogram combining independent prognostic factors was used to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of radiation-treated BRCA patients. Relative proportions of tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) calculated by CIBERSORT and mRNA levels of key immune checkpoint receptors was adopted to explore the relation between the signature and tumor immune response. As a result, 603 DEGs were obtained in BRCA tumor samples, six of which were retained and used to construct the radiotherapy sensitivity prediction model. The signature was proved to be robust in both training and testing sets. In addition, the signature was closely related to the immune microenvironment of BRCA in the context of TIICs and immune checkpoint receptors' mRNA levels. In conclusion, the present study obtained a radiotherapy sensitivity estimation signature for BRCA, which should shed new light in clinical and experimental research.", "journal": "Bioscience reports", "date": "2020-11-13", "authors": ["XingChen", "JunjieZheng", "Min LingZhuo", "AilongZhang", "ZhenhuiYou"], "doi": "10.1042/BSR20202376\n10.1007/978-3-030-20301-6_1\n10.3322/caac.21583\n10.1016/j.ejca.2007.04.021\n10.1016/j.ejca.2014.12.013\n10.1016/S1470-2045(16)30067-5\n10.1200/JCO.2016.72.0722\n10.1200/JCO.2015.65.1869\n10.1007/s12282-015-0594-y\n10.1056/NEJMoa1602253\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-1080\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.08.046\n10.1155/2017/4279724\n10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616\n10.1186/s13148-019-0730-1\n10.1016/S0001-2998(78)80014-2\n10.18632/oncotarget.22762\n10.1186/1741-7007-5-47\n10.1038/s41419-018-0852-y\n10.1200/JCO.2006.06.6944\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0310\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1178\n10.1016/j.matbio.2015.01.013\n10.1186/1476-4598-12-2\n10.1371/journal.pone.0165061\n10.18632/oncotarget.11341\n10.12659/MSM.907310\n10.1097/01.jnen.0000248543.90304.2b\n10.1097/PAS.0b013e31824ee43c\n10.12659/MSM.907461\n10.1186/1471-2407-10-614\n10.1002/ijc.28025"}
{"title": "A Pilot Study of Cardiac MRI in Breast Cancer Survivors After Cardiotoxic Chemotherapy and Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy.", "abstract": "Node-positive breast cancer patients often receive chemotherapy and regional nodal irradiation. The cardiotoxic effects of these treatments, however, may offset some of the survival benefit. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an emerging modality to assess cardiac injury. This is a pilot trial assessing cardiac damage using CMR in patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) regional nodal irradiation using heart constraints.\nNode-positive breast cancer patients (2000-2008) treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and 3DCRT regional nodal irradiation (including the internal mammary chain nodes) with heart ventricular constraints (V25 < 10%) were invited to participate. Cardiac tissues were contoured and analyzed separately for whole heart (pericardium) and for combined ventricles and left atrium (myocardium). CMR obtained ventricular function/dimensions, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), global longitudinal strain (GLS), and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as measures of cardiac injury and/or early fibrosis. CMR parameters were correlated with dose-volume constraints using Spearman correlations.\nFifteen left-sided and five right-sided patients underwent CMR. Median diagnosis age was 50 (32-77). No patients had baseline cardiac disease before regional nodal irradiation. Median time after 3DCRT was 8.3 years (5.2-14.4). Median left-sided mean heart dose (MHD) was 4.8 Gy (1.1-11.2) and V25 was 5.7% (0-12%). Median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 63%. No abnormal LGE was observed. No correlations were seen between whole heart doses and LVEF, LV mass, GLS, or LV dimensions. Increasing ECV did not correlate with increased heart or ventricular doses. However, correlations between higher LV mass and ventricular mean dose, V10, and V25 were seen.\nAt a median follow-up of 8.3 years, this cohort of node-positive breast cancer patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and regional nodal irradiation had no clinically abnormal CMR findings.

{"title": "In vitro and in vivo BNCT investigations using a carborane containing sulfonamide targeting CAIX epitopes on malignant pleural mesothelioma and breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "This study aims at merging the therapeutic effects associated to the inhibition of Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX), an essential enzyme overexpressed by cancer cells including mesothelioma and breast cancer, with those ones brought by the application of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). This task was pursued by designing a sulfonamido-functionalised-carborane (CA-SF) that acts simultaneously as CAIX inhibitor and boron delivery agent. The CAIX expression, measured by Western blot analysis, resulted high in both mesothelioma and breast tumours. This finding was exploited for the delivery of a therapeutic dose of boron (>\u200920\u00a0\u03bcg/g) to the cancer cells. The synergic cytotoxic effects operated by the enzymatic inhibition and neutron irradiation was evaluated in vitro on ZL34, AB22 and MCF7 cancer cells. Next, an in vivo model was prepared by subcutaneous injection of AB22 cells in Balb/c mice and CA-SF was administered as inclusion complex with a \u03b2-cyclodextrin oligomer.

{"title": "Small-molecule inhibitors of breast cancer-related targets: Potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer.", "abstract": "Despite dramatic advances in cancer research and therapy, breast cancer remains a tricky health problem and represents a top biomedical research priority. Nowadays, breast cancer is still the leading cause of malignancy-related deaths in women, and incidence and mortality rates of it are expected to increase significantly the next years. Currently more and more researchers are interested in the study of breast cancer by its arising in young women. The common treatment options of breast cancer are chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, and radiotherapy. Most of them require chemical agents, such as PARP inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and HER2 inhibitors. Recent studies suggest that some targets or pathways, including BRD4, PLK1, PD-L1, HDAC, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, are tightly related to the occurrence and development of breast cancer. This article reviews the interplay between these targets and breast cancer and summarizes the progress of current research on small molecule inhibitors of these anti-breast cancer targets. The review aims to provide structural and theoretical basis for designing novel anti-breast cancer agents.", "journal": "European journal of medicinal chemistry", "date": "2020-11-08", "authors": ["TingtingLiu", "ShubinSong", "XuWang", "JifuHao"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112954"}

{"title": "Detecting Vasodilation as Potential Diagnostic Biomarker in Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning-Driven Thermomics.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Early diagnosis improves outcome and survival, which is the cornerstone of breast cancer treatment. Thermography has been utilized as a complementary diagnostic technique in breast cancer detection. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the capacity to capture and analyze the entire concealed information in thermography. In this study, we propose a method to potentially detect the immunohistochemical response to breast cancer by finding thermal heterogeneous patterns in the targeted area. In this study for breast cancer screening 208 subjects participated and normal and abnormal (diagnosed by mammography or clinical diagnosis) conditions were analyzed. High-dimensional deep thermomic features were extracted from the ResNet-50 pre-trained model from low-rank thermal matrix approximation using sparse principal component analysis. Then, a sparse deep autoencoder designed and trained for such data decreases the dimensionality to 16 latent space thermomic features. A random forest model was used to classify the participants. The proposed method preserves thermal heterogeneity, which leads to successful classification between normal and abnormal subjects with an accuracy of 78.16% (73.3-81.07%). By non-invasively capturing a thermal map of the entire tumor, the proposed method can assist in screening and diagnosing this malignancy.

They are commonly altered, and BCs exhibiting FGFR gene amplification are currently being studied for drug development. Here, we aimed to compare the effects of three FGFR inhibitors (FGFRis), i.e., non-selective TKI258 and selective BGJ398 and AZD4547, on different BC-derived cell lines (BCCs) and primary tissues.\nThe human BCCs MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231(SA) (wild-type FGFR) and MFM223 (amplified FGFR1 and FGFR2) were analyzed for FGFR expression using qRT-PCR, and the effects of FGFRis on FGFR signaling by Western blotting. The effects of FGFRis on proliferation, viability, migration and invasion of BCCs were assessed in 2D cultures using live-cell imaging, and in 3D cultures using phenotypic analysis of organoids. To study radio-sensitization, FGFRi treatment was combined with irradiation. Patient-derived BC samples were treated with FGFRis in explant cultures and immunostained for Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3.\nWe found that all FGFRis tested decreased the growth and viability of BC cells in 2D and 3D cultures. BGJ398 and AZD4547 were found to be potent at low concentrations in FGFR-amplified MFM233 cells, whereas higher concentrations were required in non-amplified MCF7 and MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. TKI258 inhibited the migration and invasion, whereas BGJ398 and AZD4547 only inhibited the invasion of MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. FGFRi treatment of MCF7 and MFM223 cells enhanced the inhibitory effect of radiotherapy, but this effect was not observed in MDA-MB-231(SA) cells. FGFRi-treated primary BC explants with moderate FGFR levels showed a tendency towards decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis.\nOur results indicate that, besides targeting FGFR-amplified BCs with selective FGFRis, also BCs without FGFR amplification/activation may benefit from FGFRi-treatment.

Among them, 238 women had symptoms such as breast lump, nipple discharge, or breast pain, and the rest were asymptomatic. All participants underwent a Thermalytix test and one or more standard-of-care tests for breast cancer screening, as recommended by the radiologists. Results from Thermalytix and standard modalities were obtained independently in a blinded fashion for comparison. The ground truth used for analysis (normal or malignant) was the final impression of an expert clinician based on the symptoms and the available reports of standard modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, elastography, biopsy, fine-needle aspiration cytology, and so on).\nFor the 470 women, Thermalytix resulted in a sensitivity of 91.02% (symptomatic, 89.85%; asymptomatic, 100%) and specificity of 82.39% (symptomatic, 69.04%; asymptomatic, 92.41%) in detection of breast malignancy.

We evaluated the feasibility of deep learning-based auto-segmentation (DLBAS) in comparison to commercially available atlas-based segmentation solutions (ABAS) for breast cancer radiation therapy. This study used contrast-enhanced planning computed tomography scans from 62 patients with breast cancer who underwent breast-conservation surgery. Contours of target volumes (CTVs), organs, and heart substructures were generated using two commercial ABAS solutions and DLBAS using fully convolutional DenseNet. The accuracy of the segmentation was assessed using 14 test patients using the Dice Similarity Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance referencing the expert contours. A sensitivity analysis was performed using non-contrast planning CT from 14 additional patients. Compared to ABAS, the proposed DLBAS model yielded more consistent results and the highest average Dice Similarity Coefficient values and lowest Hausdorff Distances, especially for CTVs and the substructures of the heart. ABAS showed limited performance in soft-tissue-based regions, such as the esophagus, cardiac arteries, and smaller CTVs. The results of sensitivity analysis between contrast and non-contrast CT test sets showed little difference in the performance of DLBAS and conversely, a large discrepancy for ABAS. The proposed DLBAS algorithm was more consistent and robust in its performance than ABAS across the majority of structures when examining both CTVs and normal organs.

{"title": "Combined EGFR1 and PARP1 Inhibition Enhances the Effect of Radiation in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Models.", "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a challenging cancer with little change in five-year overall survival rate of 50-60% over the last two decades. Radiation with or without platinum-based drugs remains the standard of care despite limited benefit and high toxicity. HNSCCs often overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and inhibition of EGFR signaling enhances radiation sensitivity by interfering with repair of radiation-induced DNA breaks. Poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) also participates in DNA damage repair, but its inhibition provides benefit in cancers that lack DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) such as BRCA-mutant breast cancer. HNSCCs in contrast are typically BRCA wild-type and proficient in HR repair, making it challenging to apply anti-PARP1 therapy in this model. A recently published study showed that a combination of EGFR and PARP1 inhibition induced more DNA damage and greater growth control than each single agent in HNSCC cells. This led us to hypothesize that a combination of EGFR and PARP1 inhibition would enhance the efficacy of radiation to a greater extent than each single agent, providing a rationale for paradigm-shifting combinatorial approaches to improve the standard of care in HNSCC. Here, we report a proof-of-concept study using Detroit562 HNSCC cells, which are proficient for DNA repair by both HR and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanisms. We tested the effect of adding cetuximab and/or olaparib (inhibitors of EGFR and PARP1, respectively) to radiation and compared it to that of cisplatin and radiation combination, which is the standard of care. Our results demonstrate that the combination of cetuximab and olaparib with radiation was superior to the combination of any single drug with radiation in terms of induction of unrepaired DNA damage, induction of senescence, apoptosis and clonogenic death, and tumor growth control in mouse xenografts. Combined with our recently published phase I safety data on cetuximab/olaparib/radiation triple combination, the data reported here demonstrate a potential for combining biologically-based therapies that might optimize radiosensitization in HNSCC.", "journal": "Radiation research", "date": "2020-09-17", "authors": ["Barbara AFrederick", "RohitGupta", "AmandlaAtilano-Roque", "Tin TinSu", "DavidRaben"], "doi": "10.1667/RR15480.1"}

In this review article, we describe applications of ML-based CAD systems in MRI covering the detection of diagnostically challenging lesions of the breast such as nonmass enhancing (NME) lesions, and furthermore discuss how multiparametric MRI and radiomics can be applied to the study of NME, including prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Since ML has been widely used in the medical imaging community, we provide an overview about the state-of-the-art and novel techniques applied as classifiers to CAD systems. The differences in the CAD systems in MRI of the breast for several standard and novel applications for NME are explained in detail to provide important examples, illustrating: 1) CAD for detection and diagnosis, 2) CAD in multiparametric imaging, 3) CAD in NAC, and 4) breast cancer radiomics.

In 3-D radiotherapy, delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) is an essential step in the establishment of treatment plans. However, manual delineation is subjective and time consuming. In this study, we propose an automated segmentation model based on deep neural networks for the breast cancer CTV in planning computed tomography (CT). Our model is composed of three stages that work in a cascade manner, making it applicable to real-world scenarios. The first stage determines which slices contain CTVs, as not all CT slices include breast lesions. The second stage detects the region of the human body in an entire CT slice, eliminating boundary areas, which may have side effects for the segmentation of the CTV. The third stage delineates the CTV. To permit the network to focus on the breast mass in the slice, a novel dynamically strided convolution operation, which shows better performance than standard convolution, is proposed. To train and evaluate the model, a large dataset containing 455 cases and 50 425 CT slices is constructed. The proposed model achieves an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.802 and 0.801 for right-0 and left-sided breast, respectively.

Previous studies have shown that by evaluating CPH risk with a nonlinear deep neural network, DeepSurv, patient survival can be modeled more accurately. In this work, we apply DeepSurv to a test case: breast cancer patients with brain metastases who have received stereotactic radiosurgery.\nSurvival times, censorship status, and 27 covariates including age, staging information, and hormone receptor status were provided for 1673 patients by the NCDB. Monte Carlo cross-validation with 50 samples of 1400 patients was used to train and validate the DeepSurv, CPH, and RPA models independently. DeepSurv was implemented with L2 regularization, batch normalization, dropout, Nesterov momentum, and learning rate decay. RPA was implemented as a random survival forest (RSF). Concordance indices of test sets of 140 patients were used for each sample to assess the generalizable predictive capacity of each model.\nFollowing hyperparameter tuning, DeepSurv was trained at 32\u00a0min per sample on a 1.33\u00a0GHz quad-core CPU. Test set concordance indices of 0.7488\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0049, 0.6251\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0047, and 0.7368\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0047, were found for DeepSurv, CPH, and RSF, respectively. A Tukey HSD test demonstrates a statistically significant difference between the mean concordance indices of the three models.\nOur results suggest that deep learning-based survival prediction can outperform traditional models, specifically in a case where an accurate prognosis is highly clinically relevant. We recommend that where appropriate data are available, deep learning-based prognostic indicators should be used to supplement classical statistics.", "journal": "Journal of applied clinical medical physics", "date": "2020-08-14", "authors": ["NoahBice", "NeilKirby", "TylerBahr", "KarlRasmussen", "DanielSaenz", "TimothyWagner", "NikoPapanikolaou", "MohamadFakhreddine"], "doi": "10.1002/acm2.12995"}

Nevertheless, data regarding their use in combination with radiotherapy are still scarce. We performed a retrospective preliminary analysis of breast cancer patients treated at our Center with palliative radiation therapy and concurrent CDK4/6 inhibitors. Toxicities were measured according to CTCAE 4.0, local response according to RECIST 1.1 or PERCIST 1.0 and pain control using verbal numeric scale. 18 patients (32 treated sites) were identified; 50% received palbociclib, 33.3% ribociclib and 16.7% abemacliclib. Acute non-hematologic toxicity was fair, with the only exception of a patient who developed G3 ileitis. During 3\u00a0months following RT, 61.1% of patients developed G 3-4 neutropenia; nevertheless no patient required permanent suspension of treatment. Pain control was complete in 88.2% of patients three months after radiotherapy; 94.4% of patients achieved and maintained local control of disease. Radiotherapy concomitant to CDK4/6 inhibitors is feasible and characterized by a fair toxicity profile, with isolated episodes of high-grade reversible intestinal toxicity. Rate of G 3-4 neutropenia was comparable with that measured for CDK4/6 inhibitors alone.

Artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising solution. Plastic surgery is an innovative surgical specialty expected to implement AI into current and future practices. It is important for all plastic surgeons to understand how AI may affect current and future practice, and to recognise its potential limitations.\nPeer-reviewed published literature and online content were comprehensively reviewed. We report current applications of AI in plastic surgery and possible future applications based on published literature and continuing scientific studies, and detail its potential limitations and ethical considerations.\nCurrent machine learning models using convolutional neural networks can evaluate breast mammography and differentiate benign and malignant tumours as accurately as specialist doctors, and motion sensor surgical instruments can collate real-time data to advise intraoperative technical adjustments. Centralised big data portals are expected to collate large datasets to accelerate understanding of disease pathogeneses and best practices. Information obtained using computer vision could guide intraoperative surgical decisions in unprecedented detail and semi-autonomous surgical systems guided by AI algorithms may enable improved surgical outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Surgeons must collaborate with computer scientists to ensure that AI algorithms inform clinically relevant health objectives and are interpretable.

Cox regression analysis was employed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that non-PMRT, Charlson comorbidity index \u2265 2, advanced clinical T or N stage, pathologic partial response, pathologic stationary disease, or pathologic progression disease were poor prognostic factors for OS. Well-differentiated tumor grade, pathologic complete response, and positive hormone receptors were better independent prognostic factors for OS. Adjusted HRs derived from PMRT for breast cancer after NACT and TM were 0.69 (0.53-0.89) and 0.74 (0.59-0.93) in clinical T3 and T4, respectively. aHRs derived from PMRT for breast cancer after NACT and TM were 0.67 (0.45-0.99), 0.75 (0.62-0.92), and 0.77 (0.60-0.98) in clinical N0, N1, N2-3, respectively. The aHRs (95% CI) of the PMRT group to the non-PMRT group for LRR-free survival and DFS were improved significantly.

{"title": "Exploring Drug Treatment Patterns Based on the Action of Drug and Multilayer Network Model.", "abstract": "Some drugs can be used to treat multiple diseases, suggesting potential patterns in drug treatment. Determination of drug treatment patterns can improve our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, enabling drug repurposing. A drug can be associated with a multilayer tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (TSPPI) network for the diseases it is used to treat. Proteins usually interact with other proteins to achieve functions that cause diseases. Hence, studying drug treatment patterns is similar to studying common module structures in multilayer TSPPI networks. Therefore, we propose a network-based model to study the treatment patterns of drugs. The method was designated SDTP (studying drug treatment pattern) and was based on drug effects and a multilayer network model. To demonstrate the application of the SDTP method, we focused on analysis of trichostatin A (TSA) in leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. We constructed a TSPPI multilayer network and obtained candidate drug-target modules from the network. Gene ontology analysis provided insights into the significance of the drug-target modules and co-expression networks. Finally, two modules were obtained as potential treatment patterns for TSA. Through analysis of the significance, composition, and functions of the selected drug-target modules, we validated the feasibility and rationality of our proposed SDTP method for identifying drug treatment patterns. In summary, our novel approach used a multilayer network model to overcome the shortcomings of single-layer networks and combined the network with information on drug activity. Based on the discovered drug treatment patterns, we can predict the potential diseases that the drug can treat.

To this aim, in the present study, the samples of 115\u00a0patients with breast cancer were collected, and MAGE\u2011As and CTLA\u20114 levels in breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues were assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The effect of 5\u2011aza\u20112'\u2011deoxycytidine (5DC) on the expression of MAGE\u2011As in breast cancer cell lines was assessed by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative PCR and western blot assay.

{"title": "Targeting disseminated estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer cells in bone marrow.", "abstract": "Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer can recur up to 20 years after initial diagnosis. Delayed recurrences arise from disseminated tumors cells (DTCs) in sites such as bone marrow that remain quiescent during endocrine therapy and subsequently proliferate to produce clinically detectable metastases. Identifying therapies that eliminate DTCs and/or effectively target cells transitioning to proliferation promises to reduce risk of recurrence. To tackle this problem, we utilized a 3D co-culture model incorporating ER+ breast cancer cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to represent DTCs in a bone marrow niche. 3D co-cultures maintained cancer cells in a quiescent, viable state as measured by both single-cell and population-scale imaging. Single-cell imaging methods for metabolism by fluorescence lifetime (FLIM) of NADH and signaling by kinases Akt and ERK revealed that breast cancer cells utilized oxidative phosphorylation and signaling by Akt to a greater extent both in 3D co-cultures and a mouse model of ER+ breast cancer cells in bone marrow. Using our 3D co-culture model, we discovered that combination therapies targeting oxidative phosphorylation via the thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibitor, D9, and the Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, preferentially eliminated breast cancer cells without altering viability of bone marrow stromal cells. Treatment of mice with disseminated ER+ human breast cancer showed that D9 plus MK-2206 blocked formation of new metastases more effectively than tamoxifen. These data establish an integrated experimental system to investigate DTCs in bone marrow and identify combination therapy against metabolic and kinase targets as a promising approach to effectively target these cells and reduce risk of recurrence in breast cancer.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2020-07-18", "authors": ["Johanna MBuschhaus", "Brock AHumphries", "Samantha SEckley", "Tanner HRobison", "Alyssa CCutter", "ShrilaRajendran", "Henry RHaley", "Avinash SBevoor", "Kathryn ELuker", "Gary DLuker"], "doi": "10.1038/s41388-020-01391-z\n10.1158/078-0432.CCR-13-838"}
{"title": "COVID-19 infection can cause chemotherapy resistance development in patients with breast cancer and tamoxifen may cause susceptibility to COVID-19 infection.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is the second most common cause of death in women. Estrogen plays an important role in breast tumor etiopathogenesis. Tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs are used in breast cancer patients who have a positive estrogen receptor (ER). While angiotensin II plays a key role in breast cancer etiology and causes tamoxifen resistance, angiotensin 1-7 has been reported to may reduce the spread and invasion of breast cancer. During the COVID-19 infection, the virus blocks ACE2, and angiotensin 1-7 production discontinued. Angiotensin III production may increase as angiotensin II destruction is reduced. Thus, aminopeptidase upregulation may occur. Increased aminopeptidase may develop resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Estrogen can have a protective effect against COVID-19. Estrogen increase causes ER-\u03b1 upregulation in T lymphocytes. Thus, estrogen increases the release of interferon I and III from T lymphocytes. Increasing interferon I and III alleviates COVID-19 infection. Tamoxifen treatment causes down-regulation, mutation, or loss in estrogen receptors. In the long-term use of tamoxifen, its effects on estrogen receptors can be permanent. Thus, since estrogen receptors are damaged or downregulated, estrogen may not act by binding to these receptors. Tamoxifen is a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, independent of its effect on estrogen receptors. It suppresses T cell functions and interferon release. We think tamoxifen may increase the COVID-19 risk due to its antiestrogen and P-glycoprotein inhibitory effects.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2020-07-15", "authors": ["HulyaVatansev", "CengizKadiyoran", "MedineCumhur Cure", "ErkanCure"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110091\n10.26402/jpp.2019.4.02\n10.1002/jmv.25848"}

{"title": "A rapid volume of interest-based approach of radiomics analysis of breast MRI for tumor decoding and phenotyping of breast cancer.", "abstract": "Recently, radiomics has emerged as a non-invasive, imaging-based tissue characterization method in multiple cancer types. One limitation for robust and reproducible analysis lies in the inter-reader variability of the tumor annotations, which can potentially cause differences in the extracted feature sets and results. In this study, the diagnostic potential of a rapid and clinically feasible VOI (Volume of Interest)-based approach to radiomics is investigated to assess MR-derived parameters for predicting molecular subtype, hormonal receptor status, Ki67- and HER2-Expression, metastasis of lymph nodes and lymph vessel involvement as well as grading in patients with breast cancer.\nA total of 98 treatment-na\u00efve patients (mean 59.7 years, range 28.0-89.4) with BI-RADS 5 and 6 lesions who underwent a dedicated breast MRI prior to therapy were retrospectively included in this study. The imaging protocol comprised dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging. Tumor annotations were obtained by drawing VOIs around the primary tumor lesions followed by thresholding. From each segmentation, 13.118 quantitative imaging features were extracted and analyzed with machine learning methods. Validation was performed by 5-fold cross-validation with 25 repeats.\nPredictions for molecular subtypes obtained AUCs of 0.75 (HER2-enriched), 0.73 (triple-negative), 0.65 (luminal A) and 0.69 (luminal B). Differentiating subtypes from one another was highest for HER2-enriched vs triple-negative (AUC 0.97), followed by luminal B vs triple-negative (0.86). Receptor status predictions for Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR) and Hormone receptor positivity yielded AUCs of 0.67, 0.69 and 0.69, while Ki67 and HER2 Expressions achieved 0.81 and 0.62. Involvement of the lymph vessels could be predicted with an AUC of 0.8, while lymph node metastasis yielded an AUC of 0.71. Models for grading performed similar with an AUC of 0.71 for Elston-Ellis grading and 0.74 for the histological grading.\nOur preliminary results of a rapid approach to VOI-based tumor-annotations for radiomics provides comparable results to current publications with the perks of clinical suitability, enabling a comprehensive non-invasive platform for breast tumor decoding and phenotyping.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2020-06-27", "authors": ["AydinDemircioglu", "JohannesGrueneisen", "MarcIngenwerth", "OliverHoffmann", "KatjaPinker-Domenig", "ElizabethMorris", "JohannesHaubold", "MichaelForsting", "FelixNensa", "LaleUmutlu"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0234871\n10.1016/j.ejca.2011.11.036\n10.1016/j.radonc.2016.04.004\n10.1007/s00261-019-02028-w\n10.1002/jmri.25870\n10.1038/ncomms5006\n10.1007/s00261-018-1660-7\n10.2214/AJR.18.20218\n10.1007/s00259-019-04602-2\n10.1038/s41416-018-0185-8\n10.1117/1.JMI.2.4.041007\n10.1002/mp.12925\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2015.07.012\n10.1016/j.acra.2005.08.035\n10.1016/j.acra.2008.06.005\n10.1148/radiol.14131332\n10.1148/radiol.14131375\n10.1002/jmri.22268\n10.1159/000351193\n10.1001/jama.295.21.2492\n10.1148/radiol.14132641\n10.1111/j.1365-2559.1991.tb00229.x\n10.1007/978-1-4614-7657-3_19\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0339\n10.1172/JCI33295\n10.1634/theoncologist.2011-S1-20\n10.1088/0031-9155/61/13/R150\n10.1371/journal.pone.0118261\n10.1186/s13058-019-1187-z\n10.1007/s00330-010-1722-x\n10.3109/02841851.2010.498444\n10.1118/1.4923882\n10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2016.0066\n10.1038/s41598-020-60393-9\n10.1016/j.canlet.2017.06.004\n10.3389/fonc.2015.00272\n10.1002/mrm.22800"}

However, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are apt to apoptosis and show decreased cytotoxicity under persistent stimulation in vitro and cannot aggregate at tumor sites efficiently in vivo, both of which are two main obstacles to tumor adoptive immunotherapy. In this study, we found that the immune checkpoint T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) were up-regulated significantly on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells during their ex vivo expansion and this up-regulation contributed to the dysfunction of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Although the killing ability of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells against breast cancer cells which exhibited a high level of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was enhanced, the level of TIM-3 on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was also further up-regulated under the application of the bispecific antibody MT110 (anti-CD3\u2009\u00d7\u2009anti-EpCAM) which can redirect T cells to target cells. Besides, these \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with up-regulated TIM-3 exhibited an increased susceptibility to apoptosis. By reinvigorating dysfunctional \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and promoting them to accumulate at tumor sites, the combined use of TIM-3 inhibitor and MT110 could further enhance the anti-tumor effect of the adoptively transfused \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.

Lack of early diagnosis, chemoresistance, and recurrence of cancer means vast research and development are required in this area. The complexity of the tumor microenvironment in the biological milieu poses greater challenges in having safer, selective, and targeted therapies. Existing strategies such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and antiangiogenic therapies moderately improve progression-free survival; however, they come with side effects that reduce quality of life. Thus, targeting potential candidates in the microenvironment, such as extracellular cathepsin D (CathD) which has been known to play major pro-tumorigenic roles in breast and ovarian cancers, could be a breakthrough in cancer treatment, specially using novel treatment modalities such as immunotherapy and nanotechnology-based therapy.

The visual results showed that the most important extracted features from non-pCR tumors are in the peripheral region. The proposed method was more productive than the previous ones.\nEven with a limited training dataset size, the proposed and developed CNN model using DCE-MR images acquired before and after the first chemotherapy was able to classify pCR and non-pCR patients with substantial accuracy.

This work uses convolutional neural networks in a database of 440 infrared images of 88 patients, classifying them into two classes: normal and pathology. During the training of the networks, we use transfer learning of the following convolutional neural network architectures: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and VGG-19. Our results show the great potential of using deep learning techniques combined with infrared images in the aid of breast cancer diagnosis.", "journal": "Applied optics", "date": "2020-06-17", "authors": ["EsdrasChaves", "Caroline BGon\u00e7alves", "Marcelo KAlbertini", "SoojeongLee", "GwanggilJeon", "Henrique CFernandes"], "doi": "10.1364/AO.386037"}

Moreover, these features can be used to develop computational models that may serve as a tool for personalized diagnosis and treatment guidance.

While altered glucose metabolism in CAFs could fuel cancer cells, how such metabolic reprogramming emerges and is sustained needs further investigation. Studying fibroblasts isolated from patients with benign breast tissues and breast cancer, in conjunction with multiple animal models, we demonstrate that CAFs exhibit a metabolic shift toward lactate and pyruvate production and fuel biosynthetic pathways of cancer cells. The depletion or suppression of the lactate production of CAFs alter the tumor metabolic profile and impede tumor growth. The glycolytic phenotype of the CAFs is in part sustained through epigenetic reprogramming of HIF-1\u03b1 and glycolytic enzymes. Hypoxia induces epigenetic reprogramming of normal fibroblasts, resulting in a pro-glycolytic, CAF-like transcriptome. Our findings suggest that the glucose metabolism of CAFs evolves during tumor progression, and their breast cancer-promoting phenotype is partly mediated by oxygen-dependent epigenetic modifications.", "journal": "Cell reports", "date": "2020-06-04", "authors": ["Lisa MBecker", "Joyce TO'Connell", "Annie PVo", "Margo PCain", "DesireeTampe", "LaurenBizarro", "HikaruSugimoto", "Anna KMcGow", "John MAsara", "SaraLovisa", "Kathleen MMcAndrews", "RafalZielinski", "Philip LLorenzi", "MichaelZeisberg", "SughraRaza", "Valerie SLeBleu", "RaghuKalluri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107701"}

Effectiveness data (local recurrence, distant metastases, survival), and toxicity data were obtained from randomized trials when possible. Costs of side effects were included. Costs were adjusted to 2019 US dollars and extracted from Medicare reimbursement data. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were calculated using utilities extracted from the literature.\nThe strategy of AI-alone ($12,637) was cheaper than both APBI-alone ($13,799) and combination therapy ($18,012) in the base case. All approaches resulted in similar QALY outcomes (AI-alone 7.775; APBI-alone 7.768; combination 7.807). In the base case, AI-alone was the cost-effective strategy and dominated APBI-alone, while combined therapy was not cost-effective when compared to AI-alone ($171,451/QALY) or APBI-alone ($107,932/QALY). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, AI-alone was cost-effective at $100,000/QALY in 50% of trials, APBI-alone in 28% and the combination in 22%. Scenario analysis demonstrated that APBI-alone was more effective than AI-alone when AI compliance was lower than 26% at 5 years.\nBased on a Markov microsimulation analysis, both AI-alone and APBI-alone are appropriate options for patients 70\u00a0years or older with early breast cancer with small cost differences noted.

Automated radiomics analysis of pre- and post-NAC breast MRI involved image segmentation, radiomics feature extraction, feature pre-filtering, and classifier building through recursive feature elimination random forest (RFE-RF) machine learning. The RFE-RF classifier was trained with nested five-fold cross-validation using (a) radiomics only (model 1) and (b) radiomics and molecular subtype (model 2).

Despite their early promise, high interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneities make any rational design and analysis of these theranostics platforms extremely problematic. Recent advances in deep-learning-based tools may help bridge this gap, using pattern recognition algorithms for better diagnostic precision and therapeutic outcome. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a conundrum because of the complex molecular diversity, making its diagnosis and therapy challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a method to predict the cellular internalization of nanoparticles (NPs) against different cancer stages using artificial intelligence. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a combination of machine-learning (ML) algorithm and characteristic cellular uptake responses for individual cancer cell types can be successfully used to classify various cancer cell types. Utilizing this approach, we can optimize the nanomaterials to get an optimum structure-internalization response for a given particle.

Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2, has been shown pre-clinically to induce vascular changes that can increase delivery of chemotherapy. To quantify the role of immune modulation in treatment-induced vascular changes, this study identifies temporal changes in myeloid cell infiltration with corresponding vascular alterations in a preclinical model of HER2+ breast cancer following trastuzumab treatment.\nHER2+ tumor-bearing mice (N\u2009=\u200946) were treated with trastuzumab or saline. After extraction, half of each tumor was analyzed by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry. The other half was quantified by immunohistochemistry to characterize macrophage infiltration (F4/80), vascularity (CD31 and \u03b1-SMA), proliferation (Ki67) and cellularity (H&E). Additional mice (N\u2009=\u200910) were used to quantify differences in tumor cytokines between control and treated groups.\nImmunophenotyping showed an increase in macrophage infiltration 24\u2009h after trastuzumab treatment (P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). With continued trastuzumab treatment, the M1 macrophage population increased (P\u2009=\u20090.02).

Western blotting demonstrated that PF-477736 treatment in the background of proton irradiation increased the pro-apoptotic signaling, which was further supported by flow cytometry using annexin V. Immunofluorescence revealed that proton-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were further enhanced by PF-477736, which was linked to the downregulation of Rad51, essential for the homologous recombination repair of DSBs. Direct inactivation of Rad51 resulted in enhanced proton sensitization. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting CHK1 may be a promising approach for improving PBT efficacy in the treatment of TNBC.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "date": "2020-04-17", "authors": ["ChanghoonChoi", "Won KyungCho", "SoheePark", "Sung-WonShin", "WonPark", "HaeyoungKim", "Doo HoChoi"], "doi": "10.3390/ijms21082691\n10.1056/NEJMra1001389\n10.1038/nature11412\n10.1056/NEJMoa1706450\n10.1002/cncr.31307\n10.1016/j.prp.2018.04.001\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.08.025\n10.1186/s12885-015-1090-7\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3573\n10.4161/cc.8.8.8203\n10.1016/j.radonc.2016.12.026\n10.1038/aps.2016.136\n10.1016/j.semradonc.2017.11.009\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.12.046\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.01.046\n10.1371/journal.pone.0218049\n10.3390/ijms20194943\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.11.012\n10.1016/j.radonc.2015.08.014\n10.3389/fonc.2020.00128\n10.1002/ijc.28226\n10.1016/j.radonc.2017.09.043\n10.1016/j.molmed.2010.10.009\n10.3892/or.2012.2068\n10.1016/j.radonc.2013.06.035\n10.1016/j.breast.2013.07.005\n10.1023/B:CANC.0000031764.81141.e4\n10.1016/j.breast.2014.02.004\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.11.021\n10.1002/hed.24673\n10.3390/ijms20081894\n10.1093/annonc/mdt306\n10.1093/annonc/mdt011\n10.1146/annurev-med-050913-022545\n10.3857/roj.2015.33.4.337\n10.1038/s41598-017-15165-3\n10.1038/s41598-018-24745-w\n10.1089/ars.2016.6889"}
{"title": "AirNet: Fused analytical and iterative reconstruction with deep neural network regularization for sparse-data CT.", "abstract": "Sparse-data computed tomography (CT) frequently occurs, such as breast tomosynthesis, C-arm CT, on-board four-dimensional cone-beam CT (4D CBCT), and industrial CT. However, sparse-data image reconstruction remains challenging due to highly undersampled data. This work develops a data-driven image reconstruction method for sparse-data CT using deep neural networks (DNN).\nThe new method so-called AirNet is designed to incorporate the benefits from analytical reconstruction method (AR), iterative reconstruction method (IR), and DNN. It is built upon fused analytical and iterative reconstruction (AIR) that synergizes AR and IR via the optimization framework of modified proximal forward-backward splitting (PFBS). By unrolling PFBS into IR updates of CT data fidelity and DNN regularization with residual learning, AirNet utilizes AR such as FBP during the data fidelity, introduces dense connectivity into DNN regularization, and learns PFBS coefficients and DNN parameters that minimize the loss function during the training stage; and then AirNet with trained parameters can be used for end-to-end image reconstruction.\nA CT atlas of 100 prostate scans was used to validate the AirNet in comparison with state-of-art DNN-based postprocessing and image reconstruction methods. The validation loss in AirNet had the fastest decreasing rate, owing to inherited fast convergence from AIR. AirNet was robust to noise in projection data and content differences between the training set and the images to be reconstructed. The impact of image quality on radiotherapy treatment planning was evaluated for both photon and proton therapy, and AirNet achieved the best treatment plan quality, especially for proton therapy. For example, with limited-angle data, the maximal target dose for AirNet was 109.5% in comparison with the ground truth 109.1%, while it was significantly elevated to 115.1% and 128.1% for FBPConvNet and LEARN, respectively.\nA new image reconstruction AirNet is developed for sparse-data CT image reconstruction. AirNet achieved the best image reconstruction quality both visually and quantitatively among all methods under comparison for all sparse-data scenarios (sparse-view and limited-angle), and provided the best photon and proton treatment plan quality based on sparse-data CT.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2020-04-11", "authors": ["GaoyuChen", "XiangHong", "QiaoqiaoDing", "YiZhang", "HuChen", "ShujunFu", "YunsongZhao", "XiaoqunZhang", "HuiJi", "GeWang", "QiuHuang", "HaoGao"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.14170"}

Next-generation sequencing of pre- and postprogression biopsies was performed to identify the resistance mechanism emerging after an initial exceptional response to crizotinib. The response of the resistance mutant to type I and II MET inhibitors was assessed in cultured cells.\nAfter progressing on crizotinib, a MET-D1228N mutation was detected, which is located in the crizotinib-binding region of the MET kinase domain. Experimental studies demonstrated that this mutation confers complete resistance to crizotinib yet retains cabozantinib sensitivity. Treatment of the patient with cabozantinib led to a subjective improvement in clinical symptoms, but the patient progressed after 7 weeks.\nAlthough MET mutations are rare in breast cancer, these patients may experience substantial clinical benefit from crizotinib treatment.

NO is mainly produced from L-arginine by inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Moreover, L-arginine is an essential element for T cell proliferation and behaviors. Impaired T cell function further inhibits anti-tumor immunity and promotes tumor progression. Previous studies indicated that radiotherapy activated anti-tumor immune responses in multiple tumors. However, myeloid-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment may neutralize these responses. We hypothesized that iNOS, as an important regulator of the immunosuppressive effects in myeloid-derived cells, mediated radiation resistance of cancer cells. In this study, we used 1400W dihydrochloride, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of iNOS, to explore the regulatory roles of NO in anti-tumor immunity.

{"title": "Will traditional biopsy be substituted by radiomics and liquid biopsy for breast cancer diagnosis and characterisation?", "abstract": "The diagnosis of breast cancer currently relies on radiological and clinical evaluation, confirmed by histopathological examination. However, such approach has some limitations as the suboptimal sensitivity, the long turnaround time for recall tests, the invasiveness of the procedure and the risk that some features of target lesions may remain undetected, making re-biopsy a necessity. Recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence hold promise in addressing such medical challenges not only in cancer diagnosis, but also in treatment assessment, and monitoring of disease progression. In the perspective of a truly personalised medicine, based on the early diagnosis and individually tailored treatments, two new technologies, namely radiomics and liquid biopsy, are rising as means to obtain information from diagnosis to molecular profiling and response assessment, without the need of a biopsied tissue sample. Radiomics works through the extraction of quantitative peculiar features of cancer from radiological data, while liquid biopsy gets the whole of the malignancy's biology from something as easy as a blood sample. Both techniques hopefully will identify diagnostic and prognostic information of breast cancer potentially reducing the need for invasive (and often difficult to perform) biopsies and favouring an approach that is as personalised as possible for each patient.

{"title": "A knowledge-driven feature learning and integration method for breast cancer diagnosis on multi-sequence MRI.", "abstract": "The classification of benign versus malignant breast lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a challenging task since breast lesions are heterogeneous and complex. Recently, deep learning methods have been used for breast lesion diagnosis with raw image input. However, without the guidance of domain knowledge, these data-driven methods cannot ensure that the features extracted from images are comprehensive for breast cancer diagnosis. Specifically, these features are difficult to relate to clinically relevant phenomena.\nInspired by the cognition process of radiologists, we propose a Knowledge-driven Feature Learning and Integration (KFLI) framework, to discriminate between benign and malignant breast lesions using Multi-sequences MRI.\nStarting from sequence division based on characteristics, we use domain knowledge to guide the feature learning process so that the feature vectors of sub-sequence are constrained to lie in characteristic-related semantic space. Then, different deep networks are designed to extract various sub-sequence features. Furthermore, a weighting module is employed for the integration of the features extracted from different sub-sequence images adaptively.\nThe KFLI is a domain knowledge and deep network ensemble, which can extract sufficient and effective features from each sub-sequence for a comprehensive diagnosis of breast cancer.

{"title": "Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.", "abstract": "Needle-based procedures for diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, such as biopsy and brachytherapy, have incorporated three-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging to improve needle guidance. Using these images effectively typically requires the physician to manually segment the prostate to define the margins used for accurate registration, targeting, and other guidance techniques. However, manual prostate segmentation is a time-consuming and difficult intraoperative process, often occurring while the patient is under sedation (biopsy) or anesthetic (brachytherapy). Minimizing procedure time with a 3D TRUS prostate segmentation method could provide physicians with a quick and accurate prostate segmentation, and allow for an efficient workflow with improved patient throughput to enable faster patient access to care. The purpose of this study was to develop a supervised deep learning-based method to segment the prostate in 3D TRUS images from different facilities, generated using multiple acquisition methods and commercial ultrasound machine models to create a generalizable algorithm for needle-based prostate cancer procedures.\nOur proposed method for 3D segmentation involved prediction on two-dimensional (2D) slices sampled radially around the approximate central axis of the prostate, followed by reconstruction into a 3D surface. A 2D U-Net was modified, trained, and validated using images from 84 end-fire and 122 side-fire 3D TRUS images acquired during clinical biopsies and brachytherapy procedures. Modifications to the expansion section of the standard U-Net included the addition of 50% dropouts and the use of transpose convolutions instead of standard upsampling followed by convolution to reduce overfitting and improve performance, respectively. Manual contours provided the annotations needed for the training, validation, and testing datasets, with the testing dataset consisting of 20 end-fire and 20 side-fire unseen 3D TRUS images. Since predicting with 2D images has the potential to lose spatial and structural information, comparisons to 3D reconstruction and optimized 3D networks including 3D V-Net, Dense V-Net, and High-resolution 3D-Net were performed following an investigation into different loss functions. An extended selection of absolute and signed error metrics were computed, including pixel map comparisons [dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, and precision], volume percent differences (VPD), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff distance (HD), to assess 3D segmentation accuracy.\nOverall, our proposed reconstructed modified U-Net performed with a median [first quartile, third quartile] absolute DSC, recall, precision, VPD, MSD, and HD of 94.1 [92.6, 94.9]%, 96.0 [93.1, 98.5]%, 93.2 [88.8, 95.4]%, 5.78 [2.49, 11.50]%, 0.89 [0.73, 1.09]\u00a0mm, and 2.89 [2.37, 4.35]\u00a0mm, respectively. When compared to the best-performing optimized 3D network (i.e., 3D V-Net with a Dice plus cross-entropy loss function), our proposed method performed with a significant improvement across nearly all metrics. A computation time <0.7\u00a0s per prostate was observed, which is a sufficiently short segmentation time for intraoperative implementation.\nOur proposed algorithm was able to provide a fast and accurate 3D segmentation across variable 3D TRUS prostate images, enabling a generalizable intraoperative solution for needle-based prostate cancer procedures.

Recent data suggest inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR) may be an effective radiosensitizing strategy, and AR is expressed in 15-35% of TNBC tumors. The aim of this study was to determine whether seviteronel (INO-464), a novel CYP17 lyase inhibitor and AR antagonist, is able to radiosensitize AR-positive (AR+) TNBC models. In cell viability assays, seviteronel and enzalutamide exhibited limited effect as a single agent (IC50 > 10 \u03bcM). Using clonogenic survival assays, however, AR knockdown and AR inhibition with seviteronel were effective at radiosensitizing cells with radiation enhancement ratios of 1.20-1.89 in models of TNBC with high AR expression. AR-negative (AR-) models, regardless of their estrogen receptor expression, were not radiosensitized with seviteronel treatment at concentrations up to 5 \u03bcM. Radiosensitization of AR+ TNBC models was at least partially dependent on impaired dsDNA break repair with significant delays in repair at 6, 16, and 24 h as measured by immunofluorescent staining of \u03b3H2AX foci.

Even though aPD-1 and aPD-L1 mAbs target the same PD-1/PD-L1 axis, it is still unclear whether both mAbs exert equivalent pharmacological activity in patients who are sensitive to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, as there is no direct comparison of their pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor effects. Therefore, we evaluated the differences between both mAbs in PK and therapeutic effects in PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-sensitive mouse models.\nHerein, murine breast MM48 and colon MC38 xenografts were used to analyze the pharmacological activity of aPD-1 and aPD-L1 mAbs. The PK of the mAbs in the tumor-bearing mice was investigated at low and high doses using two radioisotopes (Indium-111 and Iodine-125) to evaluate the accumulation and degradation of the mAbs.\naPD-1 mAb showed antitumor effect in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the tumor model was sensitive to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, whereas aPD-L1 mAb failed to suppress tumor growth. The PK study showed that aPD-L1 mAb was accumulated largely in normal organs such as the spleen, liver, and kidney, resulting in low blood concentration and low distributions to tumors at a low dose, even though the tumors expressed PD-L1. Sufficient accumulation of aPD-L1 mAb in tumors was achieved by administration at a high dose owing to the saturation of target-mediated binding in healthy organs. However, degradation of aPD-L1 mAb in tumors was greater than that of aPD-1 mAb, which resulted in poor outcome presumably due to less inhibition of PD-L1 by aPD-L1 mAb than that of PD-1 by aPD-1 mAb.\nAccording to the PK studies, aPD-1 mAb showed linear PK, whereas aPD-L1 mAb showed non-linear PK between low and high doses. Collectively, the poor PK characteristics of aPD-L1 mAb caused lower antitumor activity than of aPD-1 mAb. These results clearly indicated that aPD-L1 mAb required higher doses than aPD-1 mAb in clinical setting. Thus, targeting of PD-1 would be more advantageous than PD-L1 in terms of PK.", "journal": "Journal for immunotherapy of cancer", "date": "2020-02-12", "authors": ["TaikiKurino", "ReikoMatsuda", "AyuTerui", "HiroyukiSuzuki", "TomomiKokubo", "TomoyaUehara", "YasushiArano", "AkihiroHisaka", "HirotoHatakeyama"], "doi": "10.1136/jitc-2019-000400\n10.1126/science.aaa8172\n10.1038/nrd.2018.210\n10.1200/JCO.2009.26.7609\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2607\n10.1016/S1470-2045(17)30239-5\n10.1038/nature14011\n10.7150/thno.15253\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-3477\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2141\n10.1021/jm00042a014\n10.1016/S0969-8051(97)00152-2\n10.1007/s11095-014-1378-3\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02138.x\n10.1080/19420862.2017.1337619\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-4100\n10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2009.10.008\n10.1124/dmd.114.060046\n10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.024\n10.1016/j.ccell.2015.08.004\n10.4161/mabs.28254\n10.1007/s10637-016-0411-2\n10.1002/psp4.12143\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.26.021607.090331\n10.1080/19420862.2015.1136043\n10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01777.x\n10.1002/psp4.12224\n10.3389/fimmu.2017.01287\n10.1016/j.ejca.2004.01.003\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0738"}

{"title": "Predicting the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: wavelet transforming radiomics in MRI.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of wavelet-transformed radiomic MRI in predicting the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).\nFifty-five female patients with LABC who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) examination prior to NAC were collected for the retrospective study. According to the pathological assessment after NAC, patient responses to NAC were categorized into pCR and non-pCR.

However, radiation resistance might result in a poor prognosis. Overexpression of HER2 has been related to adaptive radiation resistance. Pyrotinib is a HER2 inhibitor that shows an anti-tumor effect in breast cancer. The present study aims to explore the influence of pyrotinib combined with radiotherapy on HER2-positive esophageal cancer cells and explore the underlying mechanism. We screened two cell lines (TE-1 and KYSE30) that highly express HER2 from several human esophageal cancer cell lines. Cells were treated with pyrotinib or/and radiation. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cell migration were measured. The protein levels involved in cell cycle and DNA repair were measured by Western blot. Results showed that pyrotinib inhibited HER2 activation and exerted an anti-proliferative effect in TE-1 and KYSE30 cells. Furthermore, it enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of radiation in these two cell lines. These effects might be via inhibiting HER2 phosphorylation, inducing G0/G1 arrest, and reducing EMT and DNA repair.

{"title": "Role of Oct4-Sox2 complex decoy oligodeoxynucleotides strategy on reverse epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction in HT29-ShE encompassing enriched cancer stem-like cells.", "abstract": "Cancer stem cells are commonly tolerant toward chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Oct4 and Sox2 transcription factors are shown to be overexpressed in various cancers. At the current research, inhibition of Oct4 and Sox2 transcription factors was performed through application of decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) strategy via repressing stemness properties in HT29-ShE cells encompassing enriched cancer stem-like cells. Designed Oct4-Sox2 complex decoy ODNs were transfected into HT29-ShE cells with Lipofectamine reagent. At the next step, ODNs efficiency transfection and subcellular localization were determined via flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Further investigations such as cell proliferation and apoptosis analysis, colonosphere formation, invasion and migration, and real-time PCR assays were also carried out. Obtained results shed light on the fact that the designed complex decoys were effectively transfected into HT29-ShE cells, and they were found to be localized in subcellular compartments. Oct4-Sox2 decoy ODNs led to decreased cell viability, arresting the cell cycle in G0/G1 phases,\u00a0increasing apoptosis, inhibition of migration/invasion and colonosphere formation ability of HT29-ShE cells in comparison with control and scramble groups. Furthermore, Oct4-Sox2 complex decoy could modulate the MET process via alteration of mRNA expression of downstream genes. It could be concluded that application of Oct4-Sox2 transcription factor decoy strategy in cells with stemness potential could lead to inhibiting the cell growth and triggering differentiation. Therefore, this technique could be applied along with usual remedies\u00a0(chemotherapy and radiotherapy) as high potential method for treating cancer.", "journal": "Molecular biology reports", "date": "2020-02-06", "authors": ["ZahraBigdelou", "YousefMortazavi", "ZohrehSaltanatpour", "ZoleykhaAsadi", "MehdiKadivar", "BehroozJohari"], "doi": "10.1007/s11033-020-05280-2\n10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.11.015\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012445\n10.1002/jcp.29431"}

However, the effect of IR on the expression of eight stemness- and radioresistance-related miRNAs (miR-210, miR-10b, miR-182, miR-142, miR-221, miR-21, miR-93, miR-15b) varied, depending on cell line subpopulation and clinicopathological features of BC patients. Therefore, clinicopathological features and, potentially also, chemotherapy regimen should be both taken into consideration, for determining a potential miRNA signature by liquid biopsy in BC patients treated with RT. Personalized and precision RT dosage regimes could improve the prognosis, treatment, and survival of BC patients.", "journal": "Molecular oncology", "date": "2020-01-14", "authors": ["CarmenGri\u00f1\u00e1n-Lis\u00f3n", "Mar\u00eda AuxiliadoraOlivares-Urbano", "GemaJim\u00e9nez", "ElenaL\u00f3pez-Ruiz", "CoralDel Val", "CynthiaMorata-Tarifa", "Jos\u00e9 ManuelEntrena", "Amanda Roc\u00edoGonz\u00e1lez-Ram\u00edrez", "HouriaBoulaiz", "MercedesZurita Herrera", "Mar\u00eda IsabelN\u00fa\u00f1ez", "Juan AntonioMarchal"], "doi": "10.1002/1878-0261.12635"}
{"title": "Breast cancer diagnosis using thermography and convolutional neural networks.", "abstract": "Thermography is an entirely non-invasive and non-contact imaging technique that is widely used in the medicinal field. Since the early detection of cancer is very important, the computer-aided system can increase the rate of diagnosis, cure, and survival of the affected person. Considering the high cost of treatment in addition to the high prevalence of affected persons, early diagnosis is the most important step in reducing the health and social complications of this disease. Currently, mammography is the main method used for screening breast cancer. However, for young woman, mammography is not recommended due to the low contrast that results from the dense breast, and alternative techniques must be considered for this purpose. Breast cancer is the main cause of cancer-related mortality among women. Early detection of cancer-especially breast cancer-will aid the treatment process. Our goal is to develop software for detecting breast cancer automatically that uses image-processing techniques and algorithms to analyze thermal breast images to detect the signs of the disease in these images, allowing the early detection of breast cancer. A new algorithm is proposed for the extraction of the breast characteristic features based on bio-data, image analysis, and image statistics. These features have been extracted from the thermal images captured by a thermal camera, and will be used to classify the breast images as normal or suspected by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) optimized by Bayes algorithm. By using our proposed algorithm, a 98.95% of accuracy rate was obtained for the thermal images in the dataset belonging to 140 individuals.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2020-01-07", "authors": ["SamiEkici", "HushangJawzal"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109542"}

{"title": "Short-Term Environmental Conditioning Enhances Tumorigenic Potential of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.", "abstract": "Tumor microenvironments expose cancer cells to heterogeneous, dynamic environments by shifting availability of nutrients, growth factors, and metabolites. Cells integrate various inputs to generate cellular memory that determines trajectories of subsequent phenotypes. Here we report that short-term exposure of triple-negative breast cancer cells to growth factors or targeted inhibitors regulates subsequent tumor initiation. Using breast cancer cells with different driver mutations, we conditioned cells lines with various stimuli for 4 hours before implanting these cells as tumor xenografts and quantifying tumor progression by means of bioluminescence imaging. In the orthotopic model, conditioning a low number of cancer cells with fetal bovine serum led to enhancement of tumor-initiating potential, tumor volume, and liver metastases. Epidermal growth factor and the mTORC1 inhibitor ridaforolimus produced similar but relatively reduced effects on tumorigenic potential. These data show that a short-term stimulus increases tumorigenic phenotypes based on cellular memory. Conditioning regimens failed to alter proliferation or adhesion of cancer cells in vitro or kinase signaling through Akt and ERK measured by multiphoton microscopy in vivo, suggesting that other mechanisms enhanced tumorigenesis.

{"title": "Predicting breast cancer risk using personal health data and machine learning models.", "abstract": "Among women, breast cancer is a leading cause of death. Breast cancer risk predictions can inform screening and preventative actions. Previous works found that adding inputs to the widely-used Gail model improved its ability to predict breast cancer risk. However, these models used simple statistical architectures and the additional inputs were derived from costly and / or invasive procedures. By contrast, we developed machine learning models that used highly accessible personal health data to predict five-year breast cancer risk. We created machine learning models using only the Gail model inputs and models using both Gail model inputs and additional personal health data relevant to breast cancer risk. For both sets of inputs, six machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial data set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric quantified each model's performance. Since this data set has a small percentage of positive breast cancer cases, we also reported sensitivity, specificity, and precision. We used Delong tests (p < 0.05) to compare the testing data set performance of each machine learning model to that of the Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Tool (BCRAT), an implementation of the Gail model. None of the machine learning models with only BCRAT inputs were significantly stronger than the BCRAT. However, the logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and neural network models with the broader set of inputs were all significantly stronger than the BCRAT. These results suggest that relative to the BCRAT, additional easy-to-obtain personal health inputs can improve five-year breast cancer risk prediction.

{"title": "TRIB3 supports breast cancer stemness by suppressing FOXO1 degradation and enhancing SOX2 transcription.", "abstract": "The existence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) is a major reason underlying cancer metastasis and recurrence after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Targeting BCSCs may ameliorate breast cancer relapse and therapy resistance. Here we report that expression of the pseudokinase Tribble 3 (TRIB3) positively associates with breast cancer stemness and progression. Elevated TRIB3 expression supports BCSCs by interacting with AKT to interfere with the FOXO1-AKT interaction and suppress FOXO1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation by E3 ligases SKP2 and NEDD4L.

{"title": "CTLA4 blockade promotes vessel normalization in breast tumors via the accumulation of eosinophils.", "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown long-term survival benefits, but only in a small fraction of cancer patients. Recent studies suggest that improved vessel perfusion by ICB positively correlates with its therapeutic outcomes. However, the underlying mechanism of such a process remains unclear. Here, we show that anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) treatment-induced tumor vessel normalization was accompanied by an increased infiltration of eosinophils into breast tumors. Eosinophil accumulation was positively correlated with the responsiveness of a breast tumor to anti-CTLA4 therapy. Depletion of eosinophils subsequently negated vessel normalization, reduced antitumor immunity and attenuated tumor growth inhibition by anti-CTLA4 therapy. Moreover, intratumoral accumulation of eosinophils relied on T lymphocytes and interferon \u03b3 production. Together, these results suggest that eosinophils partially mediate the antitumor effects of CTLA4 blockade through vascular remodeling.

MA-CNN is a convolutional neural network-based approach that classifies mammogram images accurately. Convolutional neural networks are excellent in extracting the task specific features, since the feature learning is associated with classification task in order to attain the improved performance. The proposed approach automatically categorizes the mammographic images on mini-MIAS dataset into normal, malignant and benign classes. This model improves the accuracy of the classification system by fusing the wider context of information using multiscale filters without negotiating the computation speed.

{"title": "Methylene Blue-Based Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging for Breast Cancer Visualization in Resected Human Tissues.", "abstract": "Breast-conserving surgery is facing the challenge of objective tumor margin identification intraoperatively. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging would be an ideal approach to visualize tumor margins during surgeries. In this preliminary study, the feasibility of methylene blue-based near-infrared fluorescence imaging technique for breast cancer detection was assessed in resected human breast specimens after breast cancer surgeries. Thirty patients with breast cancer scheduled for surgical treatment were enrolled, including 10 patients with preoperative chemotherapy and 20 patients without. Each of them received an injection of 1 mg/kg methylene blue intravenously 3 hours before the surgery. Then, a home-developed methylene blue-specific near-infrared fluorescence imaging system was employed to image the resected breast tissues and identify the tumor by the fluorescence contrast. Specimens were taken for pathological examinations as the reference. There were no severe adverse events attributable to methylene blue. Of 20 patients, who did not receive preoperative chemotherapy, 16 exhibited fluorescent contrast on their resected tissues (signal-to-background ratio: 1.94 \u00b1 0.71). In contrast, tumors were identified in 3 of 10 specimens from patients who underwent preoperative chemotherapy (signal-to-background ratio: 1.63 \u00b1 0.38). A total of 35 tissues were sampled from 30 specimens. Besides 30 tumor samples, 5 more suspicious samples with fluorescence signal were confirmed to be benign hemorrhagic tissues. Therefore, a sensitivity of 0.63 and a positive predictive value of 0.79 were achieved by the methylene blue fluorescence imaging strategy. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using methylene blue fluorescence imaging to identify breast cancer. Preoperative chemotherapy had an impact on imaging effect, which may reduce the detection rate. After all, methylene blue fluorescence imaging has great potential to be used into breast-conserving surgery for tumor-positive margins detection, but further clinical trial study is needed ( http://www.chictr.org.cn/ Clinical Trial Registry ID: ChiCTR1800015400, Near-infrared fluorescence imaging applied in breast cancer identification with methylene blue).", "journal": "Technology in cancer research & treatment", "date": "2019-12-15", "authors": ["ChongZhang", "DaqingJiang", "BoHuang", "CongWang", "LinZhao", "XianxinXie", "ZhaoheZhang", "KunWang", "JieTian", "YahongLuo"], "doi": "10.1177/1533033819894331"}

Increased HEXIM1 expression caused differentiation and inhibited proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. Historically, HEXIM1 has been experimentally induced with the hybrid polar compound HMBA, but HMBA is a poor clinical candidate due to lack of a known target, poor pharmacological properties, and unfavorable ADMETox characteristics. Thus, HEXIM1 induction is an intriguing therapeutic approach to cancer treatment, but requires better chemical tools than HMBA.\nWe identified and verified KDM5B as a target of HEXIM1 inducers using a chemical proteomics approach, biotin-NeutrAvidin pull-down assays, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular docking. The regulation of HEXIM1 by KDM5B and KDM5B inhibitors was assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, RT-PCR, western blotting, and depletion of KDM5B with shRNAs. The regulation of breast cancer cell phenotype by KDM5B inhibitors was assessed using western blots, differentiation assays, proliferation assays, and a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. The relative role of HEXIM1 in the action of KDM5B inhibitors was determined by depleting HEXIM1 using shRNAs followed by western blots, differentiation assays, and proliferation assays.\nWe have identified a highly druggable target, KDM5B, which is inhibited by small molecule inducers of HEXIM1. RNAi knockdown of KDM5B induced HEXIM1 expression, thus validating the specific negative regulation of tumor suppressor HEXIM1 by the H3K4me3/2 demethylase KDM5B. Known inhibitors of KDM5B were also able to induce HEXIM1 expression, inhibit cell proliferation, induce differentiation, potentiate sensitivity to cancer chemotherapy, and inhibit breast tumor metastasis.\nHMBA and 4a1 induce HEXIM1 expression by inhibiting KDM5B. Upregulation of HEXIM1 expression levels plays a critical role in the inhibition of proliferation of breast cancer cells using KDM5B inhibitors.

These patients underwent a pre-interventional breast MRI exam for further diagnostic assessment before vacuum-assisted stereotactic-guided biopsy (95 malignant and 72 benign lesions). Two breast radiologists with different levels of experience independently read all examinations using the Kaiser score, a machine learning-derived clinical decision-making tool that provides probabilities of malignancy by a formalized combination of diagnostic criteria.

{"title": "Cardiac substructure segmentation with deep learning for improved cardiac sparing.", "abstract": "Radiation dose to cardiac substructures is related to radiation-induced heart disease. However, substructures are not considered in radiation therapy planning (RTP) due to poor visualization on CT. Therefore, we developed a novel deep learning (DL) pipeline leveraging MRI's soft tissue contrast coupled with CT for state-of-the-art cardiac substructure segmentation requiring a single, non-contrast CT input.\nThirty-two left-sided whole-breast cancer patients underwent cardiac T2 MRI and CT-simulation. A rigid cardiac-confined MR/CT registration enabled ground truth delineations of 12 substructures (chambers, great vessels (GVs), coronary arteries (CAs), etc.). Paired MRI/CT data (25 patients) were placed into separate image channels to train a three-dimensional (3D) neural network using the entire 3D image. Deep supervision and a Dice-weighted multi-class loss function were applied. Results were assessed pre/post augmentation and post-processing (3D conditional random field (CRF)). Results for 11 test CTs (seven unique patients) were compared to ground truth and a multi-atlas method (MA) via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement (MDA), and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. Three physicians evaluated clinical acceptance via consensus scoring (5-point scale).\nThe model stabilized in ~19\u00a0h (200 epochs, training error <0.001). Augmentation and CRF increased DSC 5.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9% and 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5%, across substructures, respectively. DL provided accurate segmentations for chambers (DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03), GVs (DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03), and pulmonary veins (DSC\u00a0=\u00a00.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04). Combined DSC for CAs was 0.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14. MDA across substructures was <2.0\u00a0mm (GV MDA\u00a0=\u00a01.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31\u00a0mm). No substructures had statistical volume differences (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) to ground truth. In four cases, DL yielded left main CA contours, whereas MA segmentation failed, and provided improved consensus scores in 44/60 comparisons to MA. DL provided clinically acceptable segmentations for all graded patients for 3/4 chambers. DL contour generation took ~14\u00a0s per patient.\nThese promising results suggest DL poses major efficiency and accuracy gains for cardiac substructure segmentation offering high potential for rapid implementation into RTP for improved cardiac sparing.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2019-12-04", "authors": ["Eric DMorris", "Ahmed IGhanem", "MingDong", "Milan VPantelic", "Eleanor MWalker", "Carri KGlide-Hurst"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.13940\n10.1016/j.neucom.2018.11.103"}
{"title": "Evolution, current challenges, and future possibilities in the objective assessment of aesthetic outcome of breast cancer locoregional treatment.", "abstract": "The Breast Cancer overall survival rate has raised impressively in the last 20 years mainly due to improved screening and effectiveness of treatments. This increase in survival paralleled the awareness over the long-lasting impact of the side effects of treatments on patient quality of life, emphasizing the motto \"a longer but better life for breast cancer patients\". In breast cancer more strikingly than in other cancers, besides the side effects of systemic treatments, there is the visible impact of surgery and radiotherapy on patients' body image. This has sparked interest on the development of tools for the aesthetic evaluation of Breast Cancer locoregional treatments, which evolved from manual, subjective approaches to computerized, automated solutions. However, although studied for almost four decades, past solutions were not mature enough to become a standard. Recent advancements in machine learning have inspired trends toward deep-learning-based medical image analysis, also bringing new promises to the field of aesthetic assessment of locoregional treatments. In this paper, a review and discussion of the previous state-of-the-art methods in the field is conducted and the extracted knowledge is used to understand the evolution and current challenges.

Accurate prediction of treatment response has the potential to improve patient care by improving prognostication, enabling de-escalation of toxic treatment that has little benefit, facilitating upfront use of novel targeted therapies, and avoiding delays to surgery. Visual inspection of a patient's tumor on multiparametric MRI is insufficient to predict that patient's response to NAC.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that manifests complex genetic changes and various prognosis and treatment response. We investigate the value of machine learning approaches to radiogenomics using low-dose perfusion computed tomography (CT) to predict prognostic biomarkers and molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer. This prospective study enrolled a total of 723 cases involving 241 patients with invasive breast cancer. The 18 CT parameters of cancers were analyzed using 5 machine learning models to predict lymph node status, tumor grade, tumor size, hormone receptors, HER2, Ki67, and the molecular subtypes. The random forest model was the best model in terms of accuracy and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). On average, the random forest model had 13% higher accuracy and 0.17 higher AUC than the logistic regression. The most important CT parameters in the random forest model for prediction were peak enhancement intensity (Hounsfield units), time to peak (seconds), blood volume permeability (mL/100\u2009g), and perfusion of tumor (mL/min per 100\u2009mL).

To address this challenge, we use the bromodomain and extra-terminal inhibitor JQ1 to down-regulate the expression of PD-L1 and thus elicit the immune response to TNBC instead of using antibodies to block PD-L1. JQ1 also inhibits the growth of TNBC as a targeted therapeutic agent by inhibiting the BRD4-c-MYC axis. The polydopamine nanoparticles (PDMNs) are introduced as a biodegradable and adaptable platform to load JQ1 and induce photothermal therapy (PTT) as another synergistic therapeutic modality. Because the JQ1-loaded PDMNs (PDMN-JQ1) are self-degradable and release JQ1 continuously, this synergistic treatment can lead to remarkable activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and induce a strong immune-memory effect to protect mice from tumor re-challenge.

{"title": "Role of Breast MRI in the Evaluation and Detection of DCIS: Opportunities and Challenges.", "abstract": "Historically, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not considered an effective modality in the evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Over the past decade this has changed, with studies demonstrating that MRI is the most sensitive imaging tool for detection of all grades of DCIS. It has been suggested that not only is breast MRI the most sensitive imaging tool for detection but it may also detect the most clinically relevant DCIS lesions. The role and outcomes of MRI in the preoperative setting for patients with DCIS remains controversial; however, several studies have shown benefit in the preoperative evaluation of extent of disease as well as predicting an underlying invasive component. The most common presentation of DCIS on MRI is nonmass enhancement (NME) in a linear or segmental distribution pattern. Maximizing breast MRI spatial resolution is therefore beneficial, given the frequent presentation of DCIS as NME on MRI. Emerging MRI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), have shown promising potential to discriminate DCIS from benign and invasive lesions. Future opportunities including advanced imaging visual techniques, radiomics/radiogenomics, and machine learning / artificial intelligence may also be applicable to the detection and treatment of DCIS.

{"title": "CAD and AI for breast cancer-recent development and challenges.", "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been a popular area of research and development in the past few decades. In CAD, machine learning methods and multidisciplinary knowledge and techniques are used to analyze the patient information and the results can be used to assist clinicians in their decision making process. CAD may analyze imaging information alone or in combination with other clinical data. It may provide the analyzed information directly to the clinician or correlate the analyzed results with the likelihood of certain diseases based on statistical modeling of the past cases in the population. CAD systems can be developed to provide decision support for many applications in the patient care processes, such as lesion detection, characterization, cancer staging, treatment planning and response assessment, recurrence and prognosis prediction. The new state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as deep learning (DL), has revolutionized speech and text recognition as well as computer vision. The potential of major breakthrough by DL in medical image analysis and other CAD applications for patient care has brought about unprecedented excitement of applying CAD, or artificial intelligence (AI), to medicine in general and to radiology in particular. In this paper, we will provide an overview of the recent developments of CAD using DL in breast imaging and discuss some challenges and practical issues that may impact the advancement of artificial intelligence and its integration into clinical workflow.", "journal": "The British journal of radiology", "date": "2019-11-20", "authors": ["Heang-PingChan", "Ravi KSamala", "Lubomir MHadjiiski"], "doi": "10.1259/bjr.20190580\n10.1259/bjr.20170545\n10.1148/89.2.211\n10.1109/TBME.1979.326560\n10.1016/0010-4809(80)90027-0\n10.1097/00004424-199010000-00006\n10.1118/1.596065\n10.1016/j.ejca.2008.02.016\n10.1056/NEJMoa0803545\n10.2214/AJR.07.2812\n10.1056/NEJMoa066099\n10.1093/jnci/djr206\n10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.5231\n10.1016/j.ejrad.2008.07.042\n10.2214/AJR.12.10187\n10.1016/j.clinimag.2018.08.014\n10.1038/nature14539\n10.1016/0031-3203(82)90024-3\n10.1118/1.597428\n10.1109/42.538937\n10.1118/1.597177\n10.1088/0031-9155/59/23/7457\n10.1088/0031-9155/60/21/8457\n10.1016/j.patcog.2018.01.009\n10.1038/srep27327\n10.1155/2019/2717454\n10.1016/j.jacr.2017.11.036\n10.1118/1.4967345\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa504e\n10.1371/journal.pone.0203355\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.12.014\n10.1016/j.neucom.2016.02.060\n10.1016/j.media.2017.01.009\n10.1016/j.compmedimag.2016.07.004\n10.1002/mp.12453\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa93d4\n10.1002/mp.12110\n10.1016/j.patcog.2017.07.008\n10.1088/1361-6560/aabb5b\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.01.011\n10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.01.017\n10.1016/j.patcog.2018.02.026\n10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.06.003\n10.1016/j.compmedimag.2018.09.004\n10.1088/1361-6560/aaef0a\n10.1007/s11548-018-1876-6\n10.1109/TMI.2018.2870343\n10.1016/j.acra.2018.06.019\n10.1097/RLI.0000000000000358\n10.1109/TMI.2017.2751523\n10.1038/s41598-018-21215-1\n10.1038/s41598-018-22437-z\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1115\n10.1148/radiol.2019182622\n10.1109/TMI.2016.2532122\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa9f87\n10.1002/mp.12683\n10.1007/s10278-017-0022-2\n10.1002/mp.12763\n10.1186/s13058-018-0961-7\n10.1016/j.acra.2017.12.025\n10.1259/bjr.20180691\n10.1148/radiol.2018180694\n10.1016/j.acra.2011.09.014\n10.1088/1361-6560/aa82ec\n10.1155/2018/4605191\n10.1109/TBME.2018.2844188\n10.1155/2018/8413403\n10.1186/s12938-019-0626-5\n10.1002/mp.13361\n10.1007/s11604-019-00831-5\n10.1016/j.neucom.2018.09.043\n10.1002/mp.13268\n10.1117/1.JMI.6.1.011007\n10.1109/JBHI.2017.2731873\n10.1109/TMI.2018.2872031\n10.1016/j.patcog.2017.08.004\n10.1117/1.JMI.5.1.014503\n10.1109/TMI.2018.2865671\n10.1148/radiol.2018181352\n10.1002/mp.12079\n10.1155/2018/5137904\n10.1016/j.patcog.2018.02.012\n10.4329/wjr.v11.i2.19\n10.1016/j.crad.2019.02.006\n10.2214/AJR.18.20532\n10.1200/JCO.2007.14.3065\n10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8080\n10.1002/1522-2586(200012)12:6<965::AID-JMRI23>3.0.CO;2-1\n10.1002/jmri.22167\n10.3322/canjclin.57.2.75\n10.1016/j.jacr.2009.09.022\n10.1007/s00330-011-2091-9\n10.1007/s40846-016-0163-7\n10.1002/jmri.25870\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0238\n10.1002/jmri.26518\n10.1093/jnci/djy222\n10.1007/s00330-019-06186-9\n10.1016/j.jacr.2019.05.012\n10.2214/AJR.17.18185\n10.1118/1.4816310\n10.1148/radiol.2018171093\n10.1371/journal.pmed.1002683\n10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.5474\n10.1118/1.4807642"}
{"title": "Overview of radiomics in breast cancer diagnosis and prognostication.", "abstract": "Diagnosis of early invasive breast cancer relies on radiology and clinical evaluation, supplemented by biopsy confirmation. At least three issues burden this approach: a) suboptimal sensitivity and suboptimal positive predictive power of radiology screening and diagnostic approaches, respectively; b) invasiveness of biopsy with discomfort for women undergoing diagnostic tests; c) long turnaround time for recall tests. In the screening setting, radiology sensitivity is suboptimal, and when a suspicious lesion is detected and a biopsy is recommended, the positive predictive value of radiology is modest. Recent technological advances in medical imaging, especially in the field of artificial intelligence applied to image analysis, hold promise in addressing clinical challenges in cancer detection, assessment of treatment response, and monitoring disease progression. Radiomics include feature extraction from clinical images; these features are related to tumor size, shape, intensity, and texture, collectively providing comprehensive tumor characterization, the so-called radiomics signature of the tumor.

Estrogen deficiency is the primary reason for trabecular bone loss in postmenopausal women. By reducing estrogen levels aromatase inhibitors (AI) as part of breast cancer therapy promote bone loss. Bisphosphonates (BP) are recommended to counteract this adverse drug effect. The purpose of our study was to quantify VBM proton density fat fraction (PDFF) changes at the lumbar spine using chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI (CSE-MRI) and bone mineral density (BMD) changes using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) related to AI and BP treatment over a 12-month period.\nTwenty seven postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving AI therapy were recruited for this study. 22 subjects completed the 12-month study. 14 subjects received AI and BP (AI+BP), 8 subjects received AI without BP (AI-BP). All subjects underwent 3\u2009T MRI. An eight-echo 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence was used for CSE-based water-fat separation at the lumbar spine to generate PDFF maps.

We sought to determine whether nodal pCR is associated with likelihood of receiving nodal radiation and whether radiation therapy among patients experiencing nodal pCR is associated with improved OS.\nClinical N1 (cN1) female breast cancer patients diagnosed during 2010 to 2015 who were ypN0 (ie, nodal pCR; n = 12,341) or ypN1 (ie, residual disease; n = 13,668) after NACT were identified in the National Cancer Database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receiving radiation therapy. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the association between radiation therapy and adjusted OS.\nThe study included 26,009 patients; 43.9% (n = 5423) of ypN0 and 55.3% (n = 7556) of ypN1 patients received nodal radiation. Rates of nodal radiation remained the same over time among ypN0 patients (trend test, P = .29) but increased among ypN1 patients from 49% in 2010 to 59% in 2015 (trend test, P < .001). After adjusting for covariates, nodal pCR (vs no stage change) was associated with decreased likelihood of nodal radiation after mastectomy (\u223c20% decrease) and lumpectomy (\u223c30% decrease; both P < .01). After mastectomy, nodal (vs no) radiation conferred no significant survival benefit in ypN0 patients, but it approached significance for ypN1 patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.99, P = .04; overall P = .11). After lumpectomy, nodal radiation was associated with improved adjusted OS for ypN0 (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22-0.66) and ypN1 patients (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30-0.66; both P < .001), but this improvement was not significantly greater than that associated with breast-only radiation.\nypN0 patients were less likely to receive nodal radiation than ypN1 patients were, suggesting that selective omission already occurs and, in the context of limited survival data, could potentially be appropriate for select patients.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2019-11-05", "authors": ["Oluwadamilola MFayanju", "YiRen", "GitaSuneja", "Samantha MThomas", "Rachel AGreenup", "Jennifer KPlichta", "Laura HRosenberger", "JeremyForce", "TerryHyslop", "E ShelleyHwang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2019.10.039"}

Potentially addressing these limitations, we investigated the outcomes of gas and gasless robot-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy (RANSM) with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). Ten patients underwent 12 RANSM with IBR between November 2016 and April 2018. Patients with tumors measuring >5\u2009cm in diameter, tumor invasion of the skin or nipple-areolar complex, proven metastatic lymph nodes, or planned radiotherapy were excluded. Age, breast weight, diagnosis, tumor size, hormone receptor status, and operation time were retrospectively collected. Postoperative outcomes including postoperative complications and final margin status of resected were analyzed. The median total operation time and console time were 351\u2009min (267-480\u2009min) and 51\u2009min (18-143\u2009min), respectively. The learning curve presented as a cumulative sum graph showed that the console time decreased and then stabilized at the eighth case. There was no open conversion or major postoperative complication. One patient had self-resolved partial nipple ischemia, and two patients experienced partial skin ischemia. We deemed that RANSM with IBR is safe and feasible for early breast cancer, benign disease of the breast, and BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers. RANSM is an advanced surgical method with a short learning curve.", "journal": "Scientific reports", "date": "2019-11-02", "authors": ["Hyung SeokPark", "JeeaLee", "Dong WonLee", "Seung YongSong", "Dae HyunLew", "Seung IlKim", "Young UpCho"], "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-51744-2\n10.1155/2012/921821\n10.1007/s10549-010-1258-4\n10.1016/j.breast.2016.10.009\n10.3322/caac.21160\n10.1097/sla.0000000000001397\n10.1111/tbj.12937\n10.1097/acm.0000000000002227\n10.1002/ase.198\n10.4048/jbc.2018.21.e45\n10.3109/13645706.2014.894918\n10.1097/sle.0000000000000016\n10.14449/jbd.2015.3.2.43\n10.1245/s10434-018-6704-2\n10.1007/s00268-017-4209-y\n10.1245/s10434-018-6555-x\n10.1016/0007-1226(95)90099-3"}

The anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab demonstrated clinical activity in mTNBC patients with PD-L1-positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells. The current study describes the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) and genomic evolution across sequential therapies in a patient with a 31-year history of TNBC and a complete response (CR) to atezolizumab monotherapy.\nIn 1986, the patient had surgery and radiotherapy (XRT) for newly diagnosed TNBC, followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for two locoregional recurrences. She developed mTNBC in 2009 and was sequentially treated with capecitabine, gemcitabine-carboplatin-iniparib (GCI), XRT and an experimental vaccine. She experienced disease progression (PD) to all these therapies. In 2013, she had a PD-L1 positive tumor and enrolled in a phase 1 atezolizumab monotherapy study (PCD4989g; NCT01375842). She received atezolizumab for 1\u2009year with initial pseudo-progression followed by a partial response. After 1\u2009year without treatment she experienced PD, reinitiated atezolizumab and subsequently achieved CR. Tumor specimens were collected at numerous times between 2008 and 2015 and assessed by immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq and DNA-seq.\nTiME biomarkers, including CD8, ICs and PD-L1 on IC, increased after capecitabine and remained high after GCI, XRT and through pseudo-progression on atezolizumab. At PD post-atezolizumab exposure, TiME biomarkers decreased but PD-L1 status remained positive. Immune-related RNA signatures confirmed these findings. TNBC subtyping revealed evolution from luminal androgen receptor (LAR) to basal-like immune activated (BLIA). Genomic profiling showed truncal alterations in RB1 and TP53, while the presence of other genomic alterations varied over time. Tumor mutational burden peaked after XRT and declined after atezolizumab exposure.\nThis case report describes the evolution of TiME and TNBC molecular subtypes/genomics over time with sequential therapies in a TNBC patient with a CR to atezolizumab monotherapy.

{"title": "Targeting the Hedgehog pathway in combination with X\u2011ray or carbon ion radiation decreases migration of MCF\u20117 breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "The use of carbon ion therapy for cancer treatment is becoming more widespread due to the advantages of carbon ions compared with X\u2011rays. Breast cancer patients may benefit from these advantages, as the surrounding healthy tissues receive a lower dose, and the increased biological effectiveness of carbon ions can better control radioresistant cancer cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is linked to the development and progression of breast cancer, as well as to resistance to X\u2011irradiation and the migratory capacity of cancer cells. Hence, there is an increasing interest in targeting the Hh pathway in combination with radiotherapy. Several studies have already investigated this treatment strategy with conventional radiotherapy. However, to the best of our knowledge, the combination of Hh inhibitors with particle therapy has not yet been explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of the Hh inhibitor GANT61 as an effective modulator of radiosensitivity and migration potential in MCF\u20117 breast cancer cells, and compare potential differences between carbon ion irradiation and X\u2011ray exposure. Although Hh targeting was not able to radiosensitise cells to any radiation type used, the combination of GANT61 with X\u2011rays or carbon ions (energy: 95 MeV/n; linear energy transfer: 73\u00a0keV/\u00b5m) was more effective in decreasing MCF\u20117 cell migration compared with either radiation type alone. Gene expression of the Hh pathway was affected to different degrees in response to X\u2011ray and carbon ion irradiation, as well as in response to the combination of GANT61 with irradiation. In conclusion, combining Hh inhibition with radiation (X\u2011rays or carbon ions) more effectively decreased breast cancer cell migration compared with radiation treatment alone.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "2019-10-23", "authors": ["KatrienKonings", "NielsBelmans", "RandyVermeesen", "BjornBaselet", "GretaLamers", "AnnJanssen", "SofieIsebaert", "SarahBaatout", "KarinHaustermans", "MarjanMoreels"], "doi": "10.3892/ijo.2019.4901"}

The diagnosis and treatment information of breast cancer patients is abundant in multiple types of clinical fields, including clinicopathological data, genotype and phenotype information, treatment information, and prognosis information. However, current studies are mainly focused on extracting information from one specific type of clinical field. This study defines a comprehensive information model to represent the whole-course clinical information of patients. Furthermore, deep learning approaches are used to extract the concepts and their attributes from clinical breast cancer documents by fine-tuning pretrained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language models.\nThe clinical corpus that was used in this study was from one 3A cancer hospital in China, consisting of the encounter notes, operation records, pathology notes, radiology notes, progress notes and discharge summaries of 100 breast cancer patients. Our system consists of two components: a named entity recognition (NER) component and a relation recognition component. For each component, we implemented deep learning-based approaches by fine-tuning BERT, which outperformed other state-of-the-art methods on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks. A clinical language model is first pretrained using BERT on a large-scale unlabeled corpus of Chinese clinical text. For NER, the context embeddings that were pretrained using BERT were used as the input features of the Bi-LSTM-CRF (Bidirectional long-short-memory-conditional random fields) model and were fine-tuned using the annotated breast cancer notes. Furthermore, we proposed an approach to fine-tune BERT for relation extraction. It was considered to be a classification problem in which the two entities that were mentioned in the input sentence were replaced with their semantic types.\nOur best-performing system achieved F1 scores of 93.53% for the NER and 96.73% for the relation extraction. Additional evaluations showed that the deep learning-based approaches that fine-tuned BERT did outperform the traditional Bi-LSTM-CRF and CRF machine learning algorithms in NER and the attention-Bi-LSTM and SVM (support vector machines) algorithms in relation recognition.\nIn this study, we developed a deep learning approach that fine-tuned BERT to extract the breast cancer concepts and their attributes.

This suggests the need for novel combination therapies to expand the use of these drugs. Recent reports that low doses of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) plus PARPis enhance PARPi efficacy in BRCA-proficient AML subtypes, breast, and ovarian cancer open up the possibility that this strategy may apply to other sporadic cancers. We identify a key mechanistic aspect of this combination therapy in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC): that the DNMTi component creates a BRCAness phenotype through downregulating expression of key homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes. Importantly, from a translational perspective, the above changes in DNA repair processes allow our combinatorial PARPi and DNMTi therapy to robustly sensitize NSCLC cells to ionizing radiation in vitro and in vivo.

We developed and evaluated the following two distinct NLP approaches to analyze free-text notes: a traditional rule-based model, using rules for metastatic detection from the literature and curated by domain experts; and a contemporary neural network model. For each 3-month period (quarter) from 2000 to 2018, we applied both models to infer recurrence status for that quarter. We trained the NLP models using 894 randomly selected patient records that were manually reviewed by clinical experts and evaluated model performance using 179 hold-out patients (20%) as a test set.\nThe median follow-up time was 19 quarters (5 years) for the training set and 15 quarters (4 years) for the test set. The neural network model predicted the timing of distant metastatic recurrence with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.73, outperforming the rule-based model, which had a specificity of 0.35 and sensitivity of 0.88 (\nWe developed an NLP method that enables identification of the occurrence and timing of metastatic breast cancer recurrence from EMRs.

{"title": "Nitric Oxide-Mediated Resistance to Antitumor Photodynamic Therapy.", "abstract": "As an antitumor modality based on sensitizer photoexcitation by tumor-directed light, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has the advantage of being site-specific compared with conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Like these other therapies, however, PDT is often limited by pre-existing or acquired resistance. One type of resistance, discovered in the author's laboratory, involves nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in tumor cells. Using human breast, prostate and brain cancer cell lines, we have shown that iNOS is dramatically upregulated after a moderate PDT challenge sensitized by 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced protoporphyrin IX. The elevated NO not only elicited a greater resistance to cell photokilling, but also an increase in the growth and migration/invasion rate of surviving cells. Greater iNOS/NO-based resistance was also demonstrated at the in vivo level using a breast tumor xenograft model. More recent studies have shown that NO from PDT-targeted cells can stimulate a progrowth/promigration response in non-targeted bystander cells. These novel effects of NO, their negative impact on PDT efficacy and possible mitigation thereof by anti-iNOS/NO pharmacologic agents will be discussed.", "journal": "Photochemistry and photobiology", "date": "2019-09-24", "authors": ["Albert WGirotti"], "doi": "10.1111/php.13163\n10.1111/phpp.12489\n10.1002/med.21599\n10.14800/ccm.1511"}

In this paper, we propose an innovative loss function that is defined as the sum of an extended mean squared error loss and a pairwise ranking loss based on ranking information on survival data. We apply this loss function to optimize a deep feed-forward neural network (RankDeepSurv), which can be used to model survival data. We demonstrate that the performance of our model, RankDeepSurv, is superior to that of other state-of-the-art survival models based on an analysis of 4 public medical clinical datasets. When modelling the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), RankDeepSurv achieved better prognostic accuracy than the CPH established by clinical experts.

Pre-clinical data suggests a potential synergy between radiation therapy (RT) and CDK4/6 inhibitors. We assessed clinical outcomes of patients treated at our institution with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors and stereotactic radiation in the management of HR+ breast brain metastases.\nA retrospective analysis of patients who received stereotactic radiotherapy for HR+ brain metastases within 6\u00a0months of CDK4/6 inhibitor administration was performed. The primary endpoint was neurotoxicity during or after stereotactic radiation. Secondary endpoints were local brain control, distant brain control, and overall survival (OS).\nA total of 42 lesions treated with stereotactic radiation in 15 patients were identified. Patients received either palbociclib (n\u2009=\u200910; 67%) or abemaciclib (n\u2009=\u20095; 33%). RT was delivered concurrently, before, or after CDK4/6 inhibitors in 18 (43%), 9 (21%), and 15 (36%) lesions, respectively. Median follow-up following stereotactic radiation was 9\u00a0months.

{"title": "Bragatston study protocol: a multicentre cohort study on automated quantification of cardiovascular calcifications on radiotherapy planning CT scans for cardiovascular risk prediction in patients with breast cancer.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of death in breast cancer survivors. Some breast cancer treatments including anthracyclines, trastuzumab and radiotherapy can increase the risk of CVD, especially for patients with pre-existing CVD risk factors. Early identification of patients at increased CVD risk may allow switching to less cardiotoxic treatments, active surveillance or treatment of CVD risk factors. One of the strongest independent CVD risk factors is the presence and extent of coronary artery calcifications (CAC). In clinical practice, CAC are generally quantified on ECG-triggered cardiac CT scans. Patients with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy routinely undergo radiotherapy planning CT scans of the chest, and those scans could provide the opportunity to routinely assess CAC before a potentially cardiotoxic treatment. The Bragatston study aims to investigate the association between calcifications in the coronary arteries, aorta and heart valves (hereinafter called 'cardiovascular calcifications') measured automatically on planning CT scans of patients with breast cancer and CVD risk.\nIn a first step, we will optimise and validate a deep learning algorithm for automated quantification of cardiovascular calcifications on planning CT scans of patients with breast cancer. Then, in a multicentre cohort study (University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam and Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands), the association between cardiovascular calcifications measured on planning CT scans of patients with breast cancer (n\u224816 000) and incident (non-)fatal CVD events will be evaluated. To assess the added predictive value of these calcifications over traditional CVD risk factors and treatment characteristics, a case-cohort analysis will be performed among all cohort members diagnosed with a CVD event during follow-up (n\u2248200) and a random sample of the baseline cohort (n\u2248600).\nThe Institutional Review Boards of the participating hospitals decided that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act does not apply.

Cancer progression and metastasis are the main events related to poor survival of breast cancer patients.

In this context, numerous studies highlighted the possible involvement of epithelial to mesenchymal transition phenomenon as biological program to generate cancer stem cells, and thus participate to both metastatic and drug resistance process. Therefore, the comprehension of mechanisms (both cellular and molecular) involved in breast cancer occurrence and progression can lay the foundation for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutical protocols.

The diagnosis of PS is challenging because it could affect multiple organ systems and it may present before the tumour is visible by imaging. We report a malignant tumour diagnosed in a male patient who referred long-term paraesthesia and proximal muscle strength loss. After ruling out common causes of polyneuropathy, the anti-SOX1 antibody gave light to the diagnosis.

{"title": "Synthetic CT reconstruction using a deep spatial pyramid convolutional framework for MR-only breast radiotherapy.", "abstract": "The superior soft-tissue contrast achieved using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to x-ray computed tomography (CT) has led to the popularization of MRI-guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT), especially in recent years with the advent of first and second generation MRI-based therapy delivery systems for MR-IGRT. The expanding use of these systems is driving interest in MRI-only RT workflows in which MRI is the sole imaging modality used for treatment planning and dose calculations. To enable such a workflow, synthetic CT (sCT) data must be generated based on a patient's MRI data so that dose calculations may be performed using the electron density information derived from CT images. In this study, we propose a novel deep spatial pyramid convolutional framework for the MRI-to-CT image-to-image translation task and compare its performance to the well established U-Net architecture in a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework.\nOur proposed framework utilizes atrous convolution in a method named atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to significantly reduce the total number of parameters required to describe the model while effectively capturing rich, multi-scale structural information in a manner that is not possible in the conventional framework. The proposed framework consists of a generative model composed of stacked encoders and decoders separated by the ASPP module, where atrous convolution is applied at increasing rates in parallel to encode large-scale features. The performance of the proposed method is compared to that of the conventional GAN framework in terms of the time required to train the model and the image quality of the generated sCT as measured by the root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) depending on the size of the training data set. Dose calculations based on sCT data generated using the proposed architecture are also compared to clinical plans to evaluate the dosimetric accuracy of the method.\nSignificant reductions in training time and improvements in image quality are observed at every training data set size when the proposed framework is adopted instead of the conventional framework. Over 1042 test images, values of 17.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u00a0HU, 0.9995\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0003, and 71.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 are observed for the RMSE, SSIM, and PSNR metrics, respectively. Dose distributions calculated based on sCT data generated using the proposed framework demonstrate passing rates equal to or greater than 98% using the 3D gamma index with a 2%/2\u00a0mm criterion.\nThe deep spatial pyramid convolutional framework proposed here demonstrates improved performance compared to the conventional GAN framework that has been applied to the image-to-image translation task of sCT generation. Adopting the method is a first step toward an MRI-only RT workflow that enables widespread clinical applications for MR-IGRT including online adaptive therapy.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2019-07-17", "authors": ["SvenOlberg", "HaoZhang", "William RKennedy", "JaeheeChun", "VivianRodriguez", "ImranZoberi", "Maria AThomas", "Jin SungKim", "SasaMutic", "Olga LGreen", "Justin CPark"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.13716"}
{"title": "New one-step model of breast tumor locating based on deep learning.", "abstract": "Breast cancer has the highest cancer prevalence rate among the women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and reducing cancer mortality rate. However, tumor detection of breast ultrasound (US) image is still a challenging work in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD).\nThis study aims to develop a novel automated algorithm for breast tumor detection based on deep learning.\nWe proposed a new deep learning network named One-step model which have one input and two outputs, the first one was the segmentation result and the other one was used for false-positive reduction. The proposed One-step model includes three key components: Base-net, Seg-net, and Cls-net based on Anchor Box. The model chose DenseNet to construct Base-net, the decoder part of RefineNet as Seg-net, and connected several middle layers of Base-net and Seg-net to Cls-net. From the first output acquired by Base-net and Seg-net, the model detected a series of suspicious lesion regions. Then the second output from the Cls-net was used to recognize and reduce the false-positive regions.\nExperimental results showed that the new model achieved competitive detection result with 90.78% F1 score, which was 8.55% higher than Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) method. In addition, running new model is also computational efficient and has comparative cost effect as SSD.\nWe established a novel One-step model which improves location accuracy by generating more precise bounding box via Seg-net and removing false targets by another object detection network (Cls-net). On the other hand, a real-time detection of tumor is achieved by sharing the common Base-net. The experimental results showed that the new model performed well on various irregular and blurred ultrasound images. As a result, this study demonstrated feasibility of applying deep learning scheme to detect breast lesions depicting on US image.", "journal": "Journal of X-ray science and technology", "date": "2019-07-16", "authors": ["ChaoTao", "KeChen", "LinHan", "YulanPeng", "ChengLi", "ZhanHua", "JiangliLin"], "doi": "10.3233/XST-190548"}

Despite a lack of objective responses to the combination, patients who received a higher dose of TGF\u03b2 blocking antibody fresolimumab had a better overall survival when compared to those assigned to lower dose (hazard ratio of 2.73, p\u2009=\u20090.039). They also demonstrated an improved peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) counts and increase in the CD8 central memory pool. We performed additional analysis on residual PBMC using single cell network profiling (SCNP).\nThe original trial randomized metastatic breast cancer patients to either 1 or 10\u2009mg/kg of fresolimumab, every 3\u2009weeks for 5\u2009cycles, combined with radiotherapy to a metastatic site at week 1 and 7 (22.5\u2009Gy given in 3 doses of 7.5\u2009Gy). Trial immune monitoring results were previously reported. In 15 patients with available residual blood samples, additional functional studies were performed, and compared with data obtained in parallel from seven healthy female donors (HD): SCNP was applied to analyze T cell receptor (TCR) modulated signaling via CD3 and CD28 crosslinking and measurement of evoked phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets defined by PD-1 expression.\nAt baseline, a significantly higher level of expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05) of PD-L1 was identified in patient monocytes compared to HD. TCR modulation revealed dysfunction of circulating T-cells in patient baseline samples as compared to HD, and this was more pronounced in PD-1\nFunctional T cell analysis suggests that baseline T cell functionality is hampered in metastatic breast cancer patients, at least in part mediated by the PD-1 signaling pathway.

Thus, FGFR2 is regarded as an attractive tumor antigen for targeted alpha therapy. This study reports the evaluation of an FGFR2-targeted thorium-227 conjugate (FGFR2-TTC, BAY 2304058) comprising an anti-FGFR2 antibody, a chelator moiety covalently conjugated to the antibody, and the alpha particle-emitting radionuclide thorium-227. FGFR2-TTC was assessed as a monotherapy and in combination with the DNA damage response inhibitor ATRi BAY\u00a01895344.\nThe in\u00a0vitro cytotoxicity and mechanism of action were evaluated by determining cell viability, the DNA damage response marker \u03b3H2A.X, and cell cycle analyses.

In this context, recent studies showed that early breast cancer detection, along with suitable treatment, could significantly reduce breast cancer death rates in the long term. X-ray mammography is still the instrument of choice in breast cancer screening. In this context, the false-positive and false-negative rates commonly achieved by radiologists are extremely arduous to estimate and control although some authors have estimated figures of up to 20% of total diagnoses or more. The introduction of novel artificial intelligence (AI) technologies applied to the diagnosis and, possibly, prognosis of breast cancer could revolutionize the current status of the management of the breast cancer patient by assisting the radiologist in clinical image interpretation. Lately, a breakthrough in the AI field has been brought about by the introduction of deep learning techniques in general and of convolutional neural networks in particular. Such techniques require no a priori feature space definition from the operator and are able to achieve classification performances which can even surpass human experts. In this paper, we design and validate an ad hoc CNN architecture specialized in breast lesion classification from imaging data only. We explore a total of 260 model architectures in a train-validation-test split in order to propose a model selection criterion which can pose the emphasis on reducing false negatives while still retaining acceptable accuracy.

The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%.

{"title": "Cardio-oncology, the myth of Sisyphus, and cardiovascular disease in breast cancer survivors.", "abstract": "The number of breast cancer (BC) survivors has been increasing lately, due to the improvement in early detection strategies and oncological treatments. However, BC survivors are 3 times as likely to develop heart failure (HF) within 5\u00a0years of cancer diagnosis, and 7/100 of them will develop HF in a median follow-up of 8.5\u00a0years. Furthermore, HF in BC survivors has a worse prognosis compared to other causes of HF. Anthracyclines and trastuzumab have been proven to improve survival. However, they are also considered as the main causative factors of HF in BC survivors. Old patients, those with a pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) risk factors/disease, prior exposure to chemotherapy and radiotherapy are at increased risk. Serial evaluation of troponins and cardiac imaging parameters using echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance can significantly contribute to the early diagnosis of cardiac involvement before overt HF will develop. Assessment and immediate treatment of traditional CV risk factors is the first step for cardiotoxicity prevention. In BC survivors with known heart disease, the clinical stabilization is strongly recommended for cardiotoxicity prevention. Finally, in high-risk CV patients, primary prevention including cardioprotectants and/or CV drugs should be applied. According to recent studies, the early start of ACE inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers and the modification of anti-cancer treatment can prevent the decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. However, further multicenter studies are needed to establish both prevention and treatment protocols to successfully overcome HF development in BC survivors.", "journal": "Heart failure reviews", "date": "2019-05-28", "authors": ["Sophie IMavrogeni", "ElisaSfendouraki", "GeorgeMarkousis-Mavrogenis", "AngelosRigopoulos", "MichelNoutsias", "GenovefaKolovou", "ConstantinaAngeli", "DimitriosTousoulis"], "doi": "10.1007/s10741-019-09805-1"}

{"title": "A novel UCHL", "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment remains a great challenge for clinical practice and novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. UCHL3 is a deubiquitinase that is overexpressed in TNBC and correlates with poor prognosis. UCHL3 deubiquitinates RAD51 thereby promoting the recruitment of RAD51 to DNA damage sites and augmenting DNA repair. Therefore, UCHL3 overexpression can render cancer cells resistant to DNA damage inducing chemo and radiotherapy, and targeting UCHL3 can sensitize TNBC to radiation and chemotherapy. However, small molecule inhibitors of UCHL3 are yet to be identified. Here we report that perifosine, a previously reported Akt inhibitor, can inhibit UCHL3 in vitro and in vivo. We found low dose (50\u2009nM) perifosine inhibited UCHL3 deubiquitination activity without affecting Akt activity. Furthermore, perifosine enhanced Olaparib-induced growth inhibition in TNBC cells. Mechanistically, perifosine induced RAD51 ubiquitination and blocked the RAD51-BRCA2 interaction, which in turn decreased ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) of Rad51 and, thereby, homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA double strand break repair. In addition, combination of perifosine and Olaparib showed synergistic antitumor activity in vivo in TNBC xenograft model. Thus, our present study provides a novel therapeutic approach to optimize PARP inhibitor treatment efficiency.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2019-05-23", "authors": ["ZhiwangSong", "XinyiTu", "QinZhou", "JinzhouHuang", "YupingChen", "JiaqiLiu", "SeungBaekLee", "WootaeKim", "SomairaNowsheen", "KuntianLuo", "JianYuan", "ZhenkunLou"], "doi": "10.1038/s41419-019-1628-8\n10.1200/JCO.2017.77.2285\n10.1038/nature11412\n10.3322/caac.21387\n10.1186/s13058-015-0534-y\n10.1056/NEJMoa1513749\n10.1007/BF00928437\n10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70228-1\n10.1056/NEJMoa1105535\n10.1038/s41416-018-0127-5\n10.1593/neo.131694\n10.1200/JCO.2014.55.2984\n10.1101/gad.289439.116\n10.4161/cc.9.1.10290\n10.1016/j.celrep.2017.01.009\n10.1038/s41586-018-0291-z\n10.1038/nrg.2017.47\n10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0325\n10.1517/17425255.2012.681376\n10.1007/s00280-014-2397-9\n10.1016/j.ygyno.2013.07.088\n10.1186/1748-717X-6-39\n10.1016/0092-8674(95)90434-4\n10.1093/nar/gkt691\n10.1002/cbic.201200521"}

TNBC cells have increased intracellular oxidative stress and suppressed glutathione, a major antioxidant system, but still, are protected against higher oxidative stress. We screened a panel of antioxidant genes using the TCGA and METABRIC databases and found that expression of the thioredoxin pathway genes is significantly upregulated in TNBC patients compared to non-TNBC patients and is correlated with adverse survival outcomes. Treatment with auranofin (AF), an FDA-approved thioredoxin reductase inhibitor caused specific cell death and impaired the growth of TNBC cells grown as spheroids.

{"title": "Glutamine to proline conversion is associated with response to glutaminase inhibition in breast cancer.", "abstract": "Glutaminase inhibitors target cancer cells by blocking the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, thereby potentially interfering with anaplerosis and synthesis of amino acids and glutathione. The drug CB-839 has shown promising effects in preclinical experiments and is currently undergoing clinical trials in several human malignancies, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, response to glutaminase inhibitors is variable and there is a need for identification of predictive response biomarkers. The aim of this study was to determine how glutamine is utilized in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer representing luminal-like/ER+ (MAS98.06) and basal-like/triple-negative (MAS98.12) breast cancer and to explore the metabolic effects of CB-839 treatment.\nMAS98.06 and MAS98.12 PDX mice received CB-839 (200\u2009mg/kg) or drug vehicle two times daily p.o. for up to 28\u2009days (n\u2009=\u20095 per group), and the effect on tumor growth was evaluated. Expression of 60 genes and seven glutaminolysis key enzymes were determined using gene expression microarray analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively, in untreated tumors. Uptake and conversion of glutamine were determined in the PDX models using HR MAS MRS after i.v. infusion of [5-\nTumor growth measurements showed that CB-839 significantly inhibited tumor growth in MAS98.06 tumors, but not in MAS98.12 tumors. Gene expression and IHC analysis indicated a higher proline synthesis from glutamine in untreated MAS98.06 tumors. This was confirmed by HR MAS MRS of untreated tumors demonstrating that MAS98.06 used glutamine to produce proline, glutamate, and alanine, and MAS98.12 to produce glutamate and lactate. In both models, treatment with CB-839 resulted in accumulation of glutamine. In addition, CB-839 caused depletion of alanine, proline, and glutamate ([1-13C] glutamate) in the MAS98.06 model.\nOur findings indicate that TNBCs may not be universally sensitive to glutaminase inhibitors. The major difference in the metabolic fate of glutamine between responding MAS98.06 xenografts and non-responding MAS98.12 xenografts is the utilization of glutamine for production of proline. We therefore suggest that addiction to proline synthesis from glutamine is associated with response to CB-839 in breast cancer.

{"title": "Combinatorial Use of Chitosan Nanoparticles, Reversine, and Ionising Radiation on Breast Cancer Cells Associated with Mitosis Deregulation.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women worldwide and the second most common cancer overall. The development of new therapies to treat this devastating malignancy is needed urgently. Nanoparticles are one class of nanomaterial with multiple applications in medicine, ranging from their use as drug delivery systems and the promotion of changes in cell morphology to the control of gene transcription. Nanoparticles made of the natural polymer chitosan are easy to produce, have a very low immunogenic profile, and diffuse easily into cells. One hallmark feature of cancer, including breast tumours, is the genome instability caused by defects in the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC), the molecular signalling mechanism that ensures the timely and high-fidelity transmission of the genetic material to an offspring. In recent years, the use of nanoparticles to treat cancer cells has gained momentum. This is in part because nanoparticles made of different materials can sensitise cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. These advances prompted us to study the potential sensitising effect of chitosan-based nanoparticles on breast cancer cells treated with reversine, which is a small molecule inhibitor of Mps1 and Aurora B that induces premature exit from mitosis, aneuploidy, and cell death, before and after exposure of the cancer cells to X-ray irradiation. Our measurements of metabolic activity as an indicator of cell viability, DNA damage by alkaline comet assay, and immunofluorescence using anti-P-H3 as a mitotic biomarker indicate that chitosan nanoparticles elicit cellular responses that affect mitosis and cell viability and can sensitise breast cancer cells to X-ray radiation (2Gy). We also show that such a sensitisation effect is not caused by direct damage to the DNA by the nanoparticles.

Using triple-negative breast carcinomas (4T1) bearing mouse model, we proved that antibody-coupled platelets could effectively target incompletely ablated tumor with thermal ablation (TA). We found the release of anti-PD-L1 can be triggered upon the platelets activation, together with many pro-inflammatory cytokines. The release of anti-PD-L1 is likely due to the dissociation of platelets upon the activation. Our findings approved that our platelet-based platform could facilitate the delivery of immune checkpoint antibody to tumor residues and remarkably prevent tumor recurrence after ablation. Moreover, this platelet-based delivery strategy may be extended to the targeted delivery of therapeutics post other types of local therapies including photodynamic therapy, high-intensity-focused-ultrasound ablation therapy, and even radiotherapy.", "journal": "Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society", "date": "2019-05-10", "authors": ["XiaoHan", "JiawenChen", "JiachengChu", "ChaoLiang", "QingleMa", "QinFan", "ZhuangLiu", "ChaoWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.05.008"}

An AI system was used to obtain a score between 1 and 10 for each exam, representing the likelihood of cancer present. Using all AI scores between 1 and 9 as possible thresholds, the exams were divided into groups of low- and high likelihood of cancer present.

Despite the fact that the benefit was particularly significant for triple-negative breast cancer with its approval in 2008 by the FDA, this decision was later reversed as there was no improvement in overall survival in addition to significant costs.\nThe scope of the present study is to focus on the role of bevacizumab in triple-negative breast cancer through the analysis of overall survival, progression-free survival, and cost benefit among 45 patients in a French monocentric study and to discuss new paradigms of endpoints.\nAll patients diagnosed with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, for whom first-line treatment was bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel between January 2011 and April 2018 were included in this single-center retrospective study, and a chart review of all recruited subjects was performed from medical records.\nIn this real-life study among 45 patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, bevacizumab provided a significant benefit for a category of patients, with longer median progression-free survival and the ability of maintenance therapy associated to limited side effects.\nBeyond being the phoenix of breast oncology and a magnet of controversy, the case of bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer highlights one of the greatest challenges in oncology, namely to balance modest clinical benefits with exponential costs.

Here, we took advantage of in vitro and ex vivo bone cell and organ cultures to study the effects of PTN on the ability of prostate cancer cells and their derived factors to regulate bone cell activity and osteolysis. PTN inhibited the in vitro growth of a panel of human, mouse and rat prostate cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner with a varying degree of potency. In prostate cancer cell-osteoclast co-cultures, the rat Mat-Ly-Lu, but not human PC3 or mouse RM1-BT, enhanced RANKL stimulated osteoclast formation and PTN reduced these effects without affecting prostate cancer cell viability. In the absence of cancer cells, PTN reduced the support of Mat-Ly-Lu conditioned medium for the adhesion and spreading of osteoclast precursors, and survival of mature osteoclasts. Pre-exposure of osteoblasts to PTN prior to the addition of conditioned medium from Mat-Ly-Lu cells suppressed their ability to support the formation of osteoclasts by inhibition of RANKL/OPG ratio. PTN enhanced the ability of Mat-Ly-Lu derived factors to increase calvarial osteoblast differentiation and growth. Ex vivo, PTN enhanced bone volume in calvaria organ-Mat-Ly-Lu cell co-culture, without affecting Mat-Ly-Lu viability or apoptosis.

Recently, it has been reported that Palbociclib could be a novel radiosensitizer agent. In an attempt to clarify the molecular basis of this effect we have used cell lines from colorectal (HT29, HCT116) lung (A549, H1299) and breast cancer (MCF-7). Our results indicate that the presence of a p53 wild type is strictly required for Palbociclib to exert its radiosensitizing effect, independently of the inhibitory effect exerted on CDK4/6. In fact, abrogation of p53 in cells with functional p53 blocks the radiosensitizing effect of Palbociclib. Moreover, no radiosensitizing effect is observed in cells with non-functional p53, but restoration of p53 function promotes radiosensitivity associated to Palbociclib. Furthermore, the presence of Palbociclib blocks the transcriptional activity of p53 in an ATM-dependent-fashion after ionizing radiation exposure, as the blockage of p21/WAF1 expression demonstrates. These observations are a proof of concept for a more selective therapy, based on the combination of CDK4/6 inhibition and radiotherapy, which would only benefit to those patients with a functional p53 pathway.", "journal": "Cancer letters", "date": "2019-03-16", "authors": ["D MFern\u00e1ndez-Aroca", "ORoche", "SSabater", "RPascual-Serra", "MOrtega-Muelas", "IS\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez", "BBelandia", "M JRuiz-Hidalgo", "RS\u00e1nchez-Prieto"], "doi": "10.1016/j.canlet.2019.02.049"}

Patients were randomized to oral neratinib 240\u2009mg/day or placebo for 1\u2009year. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumor specimens underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PIK3CA testing for two hotspot mutations in exon 9, one hot-spot mutation in exon 20, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for PIK3CA amplification.

After long-standing use of endocrine therapy and targeted biological therapy, improved understanding of immune evasion by cancer cells and the discovery of selective immune checkpoint inhibitors have created novel opportunities for treatment. Single-drug therapies with monoclonal antibodies against programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have shown little efficacy in patients with metastatic breast cancer, in part because of the low number of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in most breast cancers. There is growing interest in the development of combinations of immunotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies for metastatic breast cancer.

{"title": "CD47 Blockade and Cowpea Mosaic Virus Nanoparticle In Situ Vaccination Triggers Phagocytosis and Tumor Killing.", "abstract": "Contemporary immunotherapies, e.g., those that target the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 axis, act on T cells to reinstate their antitumor activity. An alternative, and possibly more powerful approach is to target and reprogram the innate immune system within the tumor microenvironment. To this end, blockade of CD47 has been demonstrated as an attractive approach. Blockade of CD47 inhibits antiphagocytic signals therefore inducing macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells. CD47 blockade also primes antitumor T-cell responses by either activating antigen-presenting cells or inhibiting interactions between CD47 on cancer cells and the matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 on T cells. Here, a combination immunotherapy is identified using cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) in situ vaccination and CD47-blocking antibodies. The CPMV in situ vaccine synergizes with CD47 blockade, because CPMV in situ vaccination activates the innate immune system, leading to recruitment and activation of phagocytes. Therefore, the combination therapy targets monocytes and boosts their ability of cancer cell phagocytosis, in turn priming the adaptive immune system leading to a potent antitumor immune response. This work presents a novel strategy to promote macrophage activity to kill tumor cells, and hold promise to enhance T cells targeted immunotherapies by inducing both innate and adaptive arms of immune system.", "journal": "Advanced healthcare materials", "date": "2019-03-07", "authors": ["ChaoWang", "Nicole FSteinmetz"], "doi": "10.1002/adhm.201801288"}

Here, we examined, in a poorly immunogenic mouse breast cancer model, the potential of antibody-based immunomodulation and conventional anticancer treatments to collaborate with anti-PD-1 treatment. One requirement to improve anti-PD-1-mediated tumor control was to promote tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) priming, which was achieved by stimulating the CD137 costimulatory receptor. A second requirement was to overrule PD-1-unrelated mechanisms of CTL suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This was achieved by radiotherapy and cisplatin treatment. In the context of CD137/PD-1-targeting immunotherapy, radiotherapy allowed for tumor elimination by altering the TME, rather than intrinsic CTL functionality. Combining this radioimmunotherapy regimen with low-dose cisplatin improved CTL-dependent regression of a contralateral tumor outside the radiation field. Thus, systemic tumor control may be achieved by combining immunotherapy protocols that promote T-cell priming with (chemo)radiation protocols that permit CTL activity in both the irradiated tumor and (occult) metastases.", "journal": "Cancer immunology research", "date": "2019-02-21", "authors": ["PaulaKroon", "ElselienFrijlink", "VictoriaIglesias-Guimarais", "AndriyVolkov", "Marit Mvan Buuren", "Ton NSchumacher", "MarcelVerheij", "JannieBorst", "IngeVerbrugge"], "doi": "10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0654"}

Currently, there are limited prospective studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of both examinations and the role of synthetic mammography (SM) and computer-aided detection (CAD). Purpose To compare the accuracy of DM versus DM + DBT in population-based breast cancer screening. Materials and Methods This prospective study, performed from November 2010 to December 2012, included 24 301 women (mean age, 59.1 years \u00b1 5.7 [standard deviation]) with 281 cancers, of which 51 were interval cancers. Each examination was independently interpreted with four reading modes: DM, DM + CAD, DM + DBT, and SM + DBT. Sensitivity and specificity were compared for DM versus DM + DBT, DM versus DM + CAD, DM + DBT versus SM + DBT, and DM versus DM + DBT at double reading. Reader-adjusted performance characteristics of reading modes were evaluated on the basis of pre-arbitration (initial interpretation) scores. Statistical analysis was based on cluster bootstrap analysis using 10 000 random resamples. Results Sensitivity was 54.1% (152 of 281) for DM and 70.5% (198 of 281) for DM + DBT. Reader-adjusted difference was 12.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.2%, 19.7%; P = .001). Specificity was 94.2% (false-positive fraction [FPF], 5.8%; 1388 of 24 020) for DM and 95.0% (FPF, 5.0%; 1209/24 020) for DM + DBT, with a reader-adjusted difference in FPF of -1.2% (95% CI: -1.7%, -0.7%; P < .001). Sensitivity was 69.0% (194 of 281) for SM + DBT and 70.5% (198 of 281) for DM + DBT, with a reader-adjusted difference of 1.0% (95% CI: -6.2%, 8.5%; P = .77). Specificity was 95.4% (FPF, 4.6%; 1111 of 24 020) for SM + DBT and 95.0% (FPF, 5.0%;1209 of 24 020) for DM + DBT, with reader-adjusted 95% CIs for FPF of 4.7%, 5.4% and 5.0%, 5.7%, respectively, and a difference of -0.3% (95% CI: -0.8%, 0.2%; P = .23). Differences in sensitivity and specificity with the addition of CAD were small and not significant (P > .2). Conclusion Addition of digital breast tomosynthesis to digital mammography resulted in significant gains in sensitivity and specificity. Synthetic mammography in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis had similar sensitivity and specificity to digital mammography in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by L\u00e5ng in this issue.", "journal": "Radiology", "date": "2019-02-20", "authors": ["PerSkaane", "Andriy IBandos", "Loren TNiklason", "SofieSebu\u00f8deg\u00e5rd", "Bj\u00f8rn H\u00d8ster\u00e5s", "RandiGullien", "DavidGur", "SolveigHofvind"], "doi": "10.1148/radiol.2019182394"}
{"title": "RAMS: Remote and automatic mammogram screening.", "abstract": "About one in eight women in the U.S. will develop invasive breast cancer at some point in life. Breast cancer is the most common cancer found in women and if it is identified at an early stage by the use of mammograms, x-ray images of the breast, then the chances of successful treatment can be high. Typically, mammograms are screened by radiologists who determine whether a biopsy is necessary to ascertain the presence of cancer. Although historical screening methods have been effective, recent advances in computer vision and web technologies may be able to improve the accuracy, speed, cost, and accessibility of mammogram screenings. We propose a total screening solution comprised of three main components: a web service for uploading images and reviewing results, a machine learning algorithm for accepting or rejecting images as valid mammograms, and an artificial neural network for locating potential malignancies. Once an image is uploaded to our web service, an image acceptor determines whether or not the image is a mammogram. The image acceptor is primarily a one-class SVM built on features derived with a variational autoencoder. If an image is accepted as a mammogram, the malignancy identifier, a ResNet-101 Faster R-CNN, will locate tumors within the mammogram. On test data, the image acceptor had only 2 misclassifications out of 410 mammograms and 2 misclassifications out of 1,640 non-mammograms while the malignancy identifier achieved 0.951 AUROC when tested on BI-RADS 1, 5, and 6 images from the INbreast dataset.", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "date": "2019-02-17", "authors": ["TimothyCogan", "MaribethCogan", "LakshmanTamil"], "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.01.024"}
{"title": "Current Treatment Options for Breast Cancer Brain Metastases.", "abstract": "In the past, the standard of care for treatment of BM was whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and surgery. There has been a greater role for medical therapies in the last two decades due to the discovery of driver mutations and corresponding targeted therapies. These innovations have dramatically altered the approach to treating these patients. Some of the important mutations include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations in small cell lung cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) mutation in breast cancer, and BRAF mutation in melanoma. Disease-specific graded prognostic assessments have identified prognostic factors for each of the major tumor types associated with BM. These reflect the increased treatment sensitivity of these tumors to specific agents. Furthermore, there is a difference in the genetic makeup of BM compared to their primary tumor. Genomic studies of BM patients comparing somatic point mutations and copy number variations with their primary tumor have demonstrated that while both the primary tumor and BM share a number of common mutations, BM can often develop distinct mutations.

{"title": "Stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent lapatinib is associated with improved local control for HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases.", "abstract": "With increasing survival for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer in the trastuzumab era, there is an increased risk of brain metastasis. Therefore, there is interest in optimizing intracranial disease control. Lapatinib is a small-molecule dual HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor that has demonstrated intracranial activity against HER2+ breast cancer brain metastases. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of lapatinib combined with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) on local control of brain metastases.\nPatients with HER2+ breast cancer brain metastases who underwent SRS from 1997-2015 were included. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of local failure following SRS. Secondary outcomes included the cumulative incidence of radiation necrosis and overall survival.\nOne hundred twenty-six patients with HER2+ breast cancer who underwent SRS to 479 brain metastases (median 5 lesions per patient) were included. Among these, 75 patients had luminal B subtype (hormone receptor-positive, HER2+) and 51 patients had HER2-enriched histology (hormone receptor-negative, HER2+). Forty-seven patients received lapatinib during the course of their disease, of whom 24 received concurrent lapatinib with SRS. The median radiographic follow-up among all patients was 17.1 months. Concurrent lapatinib was associated with reduction in local failure at 12 months (5.7% vs 15.1%, p < 0.01). For lesions in the \u2264 75th percentile by volume, concurrent lapatinib significantly decreased local failure. However, for lesions in the > 75th percentile (> 1.10 cm3), concurrent lapatinib did not significantly improve local failure.

{"title": "Artificial intelligence in cancer imaging: Clinical challenges and applications.", "abstract": "Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed.

An IRB-approved study was performed in 216 patients with available pre-treatment MRIs and immunohistochemical staining pathology data. First post-contrast MRI images were used for 3D segmentation using 3D slicer. A CNN architecture was designed with 14 layers. Residual connections were used in the earlier layers to allow stabilization of gradients during backpropagation. Inception style layers were utilized deeper in the network to allow learned segregation of more complex feature mappings. Extensive regularization was utilized including dropout, L2, feature map dropout, and transition layers. The class imbalance was addressed by doubling the input of underrepresented classes and utilizing a class sensitive cost function. Parameters were tuned based on a 20% validation group. A class balanced holdout set of 40 patients was utilized as the testing set. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with one NVidia Titan X GPU.

Knowing that TGF\u03b2 expression or activation increases in irradiated tissues, we tested whether TGF\u03b2 blockade may further enhance abscopal effects in conjunction with the anti-PD-1 plus anti-CD137 mAb combination. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 blockade with 1D11, a TGF\u03b2-neutralizing mAb, markedly enhanced abscopal effects and overall treatment efficacy against subcutaneous tumors of either 4T1 breast cancer cells or large MC38 colorectal tumors. Increases in CD8 T cells infiltrating the nonirradiated lesion were documented upon combined treatment, which intensely expressed Granzyme-B as an indicator of cytotoxic effector capability. Interestingly, tumor tissue but not healthy tissue irradiation results in the presence of higher concentrations of TGF\u03b2 in the nonirradiated contralateral tumor that showed smad2/3 phosphorylation increases in infiltrating CD8 T cells.

{"title": "Tumor microenvironment modulation enhances immunologic benefit of chemoradiotherapy.", "abstract": "Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) remains one of the most common cancer treatment modalities, and recent data suggest that CRT is maximally effective when there is generation of an anti-tumoral immune response. However, CRT has also been shown to promote immunosuppressive mechanisms which must be blocked or reversed to maximize its immune stimulating effects.\nTherefore, using a preclinical model of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we developed a clinically relevant therapy combining CRT and two existing immunomodulatory drugs: cyclophosphamide (CTX) and the small molecule inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor L-n6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine (L-NIL). In this model, we treated the syngeneic HPV-HNSCC mEER tumor-bearing mice with fractionated (10 fractions of 3\u2009Gy) tumor-directed radiation and weekly cisplatin administration. We compared the immune responses induced by CRT and those induced by combinatory treatment (CRT\u2009+\u2009CTX/L-NIL) with flow cytometry, quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence and by profiling immune-related gene expression changes.\nWe show that combination treatment favorably remodels the tumor myeloid immune microenvironment including an increase in anti-tumor immune cell types (inflammatory monocytes and M1-like macrophages) and a decrease in immunosuppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Intratumoral T cell infiltration and tumor antigen specificity of T cells were also improved, including a 31.8-fold increase in the CD8\nOverall, these data show that modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment with CTX/L-NIL enhances susceptibility of treatment-refractory tumors to CRT.

Results were then assessed against ER expression, progesterone receptor (PR) expression, HER2 over-expression or not and Ki-67 expression. GRPR immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also performed on all samples. We also retrospectively compared 68Ga-RM2 and 18F-FDG bindings to 18F-FDG SUVmax on the pre-therapeutic PET/CT examination, if available. 68Ga-RM2 binding was significantly higher in tumors expressing GRPR on IHC than in GRPR-negative tumors (P = 0.022). In ER+ tumors, binding of 68Ga-RM2 was significantly higher than 18F-FDG (P = 0.015). In tumors with low Ki-67, 68Ga-RM2 binding was also significantly increased compared to 18F-FDG (P = 0.029). Overall, the binding of 68Ga-RM2 and 18F-FDG displayed an opposite pattern in tumor samples and 68Ga-RM2 binding was significantly higher in tumors that had low 18F-FDG binding (P = 0.021). This inverse correlation was also documented in the few patients in whom a 18F-FDG PET/CT examination before surgery was available. Findings from this in vitro study suggest that GRPR targeting can be an alternative to 18F-FDG imaging in ER+ breast tumors.

{"title": "High Glucose Represses the Anti-Proliferative and Pro-Apoptotic Effect of Metformin in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.", "abstract": "Metformin, the most widely prescribed anti-diabetic drug, is shown to possess anti-cancer potential in treatment of cancers, including breast cancer; decreases breast cancer risk; and improves overall survival. However, reports suggest that higher glucose concentrations may negatively impact the anti-cancer efficacy of metformin. Therefore, we examined the anti-cancer potential of metformin in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) exposed to different glucose (25 mM, 5.5 mM and zero glucose/glucose-starved) conditions. Our data indicates that a high glucose (25 mM) concentration (mimicking diabetes) significantly abrogated the effect of metformin on cell proliferation, cell death and cell cycle arrest in addition to loss of efficacy in inhibition of the mTOR pathway, a key metabolic pathway in TNBC cells. The mTOR pathway is activated in TNBCs compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, regulates the synthesis of proteins that are critical for the growth and survival of cancer cells and its activation is correlated to poor outcomes among TNBC patients, while also contributing to metastatic progression and development of resistance to chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Our studies were performed in two different types of TNBCs, MDA-MB-231 cells (mesenchymal stem cell-like (MSL)) and MDA-MB-468 (basal like-1 (BL-1)). Interestingly, lower concentrations of metformin (50, 100, 250, and 500 \u03bcM) significantly increased cell proliferation in 25 mM glucose exposed MDA-MB-231 cells, an effect which was not observed in MDA-MB-468 cells, indicating that the effective concentration of metformin when used as anti-cancer drug in TNBCs may have to be determined based on cell type and blood glucose concentration.

{"title": "Breast tumor classification using different features of quantitative ultrasound parametric images.", "abstract": "The ultrasound B-mode-based morphological and texture analysis and Nakagami parametric imaging have been proposed to characterize breast tumors. Since these three feature categories of ultrasonic tissue characterization supply information on different physical characteristics of breast tumors, by combining the above methods is expected to provide more clues for classifying breast tumors.\nTo verify the validity of the concept, raw data were obtained from 160 clinical cases. Six different types of morphological-feature parameters, four texture features, and the Nakagami parameter of benignancy and malignancy were extracted for evaluation. The Pearson's correlation matrix was used to calculate the correlation between different feature parameters. The fuzzy c-means clustering and stepwise regression techniques were utilized to determine the optimal feature set, respectively. The logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curve, and support vector machine were used to estimate the diagnostic ability.\nThe best performance was obtained by combining morphological-feature parameter (e.g., standard deviation of the shortest distance), texture feature (e.g., variance), and the Nakagami parameter, with an accuracy of 89.4%, a specificity of 86.3%, a sensitivity of 92.5%, and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96. There was no significant difference between using fuzzy c-means clustering, logistic regression, and support vector machine based on the optimal feature set for breast tumors classification.\nTherefore, we verified that different physical ultrasonic features are functionally complementary and thus improve the performance in diagnosing breast tumors. Moreover, the optimal feature set had the maximum discriminating performance should be irrelative to the power of classifiers.", "journal": "International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery", "date": "2019-01-09", "authors": ["Soa-MinHsu", "Wen-HungKuo", "Fang-ChuanKuo", "Yin-YinLiao"], "doi": "10.1007/s11548-018-01908-8"}

A random-effect model was used when heterogeneity was detected; otherwise, a fixed-effect model was used.\nSix trials comprising 4063 patients formed the comparison network. Compared with everolimus plus exemestane, the combinations of palbociclib or abemaciclib with fulvestrant showed similar efficacies in PFS and no differences in ORR. For the CBR, palbociclib demonstrated improvement, while abemaciclib did not. Incidences of severe adverse events did not significantly differ.

For each article identified, the surname of the first author, year of publication, journal of publication, Web of Science Core Collection journal category, country of affiliation of the first author, study design, dataset, study aim(s), AI methods used, and, when available, diagnostic performance were recorded.\nSixty-seven studies, 58 (87%) of which had a retrospective design, were analyzed. When journal categories were considered, 36% of articles were identified as being included in the radiology and imaging journal category. Contrast-enhanced sequences were used for most AI applications (n = 50; 75%) and, on occasion, were combined with other MRI sequences (n = 8; 12%). Four main clinical aims were addressed: breast lesion classification (n = 36; 54%), image processing (n = 14; 21%), prognostic imaging (n = 9; 13%), and response to neoadjuvant therapy (n = 8; 12%). Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and clustering were the most frequently used algorithms, accounting for 66%. The performance achieved and the most frequently used techniques were then analyzed according to specific clinical aims. Supervised learning algorithms were primarily used for lesion characterization, with the AUC value from ROC analysis ranging from 0.74 to 0.98 (median, 0.87) and with that from prognostic imaging ranging from 0.62 to 0.88 (median, 0.80), whereas unsupervised learning was mainly used for image processing purposes.\nInterest in the application of advanced AI methods to breast MRI is growing worldwide.

They constitute about 15% of breast cancer patients. TNBC, when diagnosed at stage II, has a recurrence of about 60%, while the risk of recurrence for a hormone receptor-positive cancer is about 10-20%. This particular breast cancer has no targeted treatment at the molecular level; unlike other subtypes of breast cancer, patients have only chemotherapy and radiation to rely on. They cannot benefit from endocrine therapy. Research based on cancer immunology and translational immunotherapy has been supported by early trial successes. However, major questions still exist concerning these therapeutic approaches in practice. Promising new therapies hold the potential to cure a wide range of tumor types, including those which cannot be treated with conventional therapies.

{"title": "Diagnosis of thyroid cancer using deep convolutional neural network models applied to sonographic images: a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study.", "abstract": "The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising steadily because of overdiagnosis and overtreatment conferred by widespread use of sensitive imaging techniques for screening. This overall incidence growth is especially driven by increased diagnosis of indolent and well-differentiated papillary subtype and early-stage thyroid cancer, whereas the incidence of advanced-stage thyroid cancer has increased marginally. Thyroid ultrasound is frequently used to diagnose thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to use deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models to improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer by analysing sonographic imaging data from clinical ultrasounds.\nWe did a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study using ultrasound images sets from three hospitals in China. We developed and trained the DCNN model on the training set, 131\u2008731 ultrasound images from 17\u2008627 patients with thyroid cancer and 180\u2008668 images from 25\u2008325 controls from the thyroid imaging database at Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Clinical diagnosis of the training set was made by 16 radiologists from Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Images from anatomical sites that were judged as not having cancer were excluded from the training set and only individuals with suspected thyroid cancer underwent pathological examination to confirm diagnosis. The model's diagnostic performance was validated in an internal validation set from Tianjin Cancer Hospital (8606 images from 1118 patients) and two external datasets in China (the Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Jilin, 741 images from 154 patients; and the Weihai Municipal Hospital, Shandong, 11\u2008039 images from 1420 patients). All individuals with suspected thyroid cancer after clinical examination in the validation sets had pathological examination. We also compared the specificity and sensitivity of the DCNN model with the performance of six skilled thyroid ultrasound radiologists on the three validation sets.\nBetween Jan 1, 2012, and March 28, 2018, ultrasound images for the four study cohorts were obtained. The model achieved high performance in identifying thyroid cancer patients in the validation sets tested, with area under the curve values of 0\u00b7947 (95% CI 0\u00b7935-0\u00b7959) for the Tianjin internal validation set, 0\u00b7912 (95% CI 0\u00b7865-0\u00b7958) for the Jilin external validation set, and 0\u00b7908 (95% CI 0\u00b7891-0\u00b7925) for the Weihai external validation set. The DCNN model also showed improved performance in identifying thyroid cancer patients versus skilled radiologists. For the Tianjin internal validation set, sensitivity was 93\u00b74% (95% CI 89\u00b76-96\u00b71) versus 96\u00b79% (93\u00b79-98\u00b76; p=0\u00b7003) and specificity was 86\u00b71% (81\u00b71-90\u00b72) versus 59\u00b74% (53\u00b70-65\u00b76; p<0\u00b70001). For the Jilin external validation set, sensitivity was 84\u00b73% (95% CI 73\u00b76-91\u00b79) versus 92\u00b79% (84\u00b71-97\u00b76; p=0\u00b7048) and specificity was 86\u00b79% (95% CI 77\u00b78-93\u00b73) versus 57\u00b71% (45\u00b79-67\u00b79; p<0\u00b70001). For the Weihai external validation set, sensitivity was 84\u00b77% (95% CI 77\u00b70-90\u00b77) versus 89\u00b70% (81\u00b79-94\u00b70; p=0\u00b725) and specificity was 87\u00b78% (95% CI 81\u00b76-92\u00b75) versus 68\u00b76% (60\u00b77-75\u00b78; p<0\u00b70001).\nThe DCNN model showed similar sensitivity and improved specificity in identifying patients with thyroid cancer compared with a group of skilled radiologists.

{"title": "Breast cancer resistance protein is the enemy of hypericin accumulation and toxicity of hypericin-mediated photodynamic therapy.", "abstract": "Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, overexpression of which can confer a multidrug-resistant phenotype in cancer cells and tumors. BCRP mediates efflux of numerous xenobiotics, including various chemotherapeutic agents and photosensitizers. Hypericin (HY) is a naturally-occurring photosensitizer synthesized by plants of the genus Hypericum. Our recently published results indicate that accumulation of HY in cancer cells of different tissue origin can be affected mostly by BCRP. Considering all known facts, the main goal of this study was to verify whether not only HY accumulation but also toxicity of HY-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be affected by the presence of some ABC transporters. To specifically prove our hypothesis, we used an experimental model of human leukemia cell lines differing in the expression level of the main drug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and BCRP. The lowest HY accumulation, and consequently the highest resistance to HY-PDT, was found in cells overexpressing BCRP. Moreover, pretreatment with BCRP inhibitor Ko143 significantly increased HY accumulation and sensitized cells to HY-PDT. Therefore, our findings represent direct evidence that BCRP is the nemesis of HY accumulation and toxicity of HY-PDT. Thus, we should emphasize that individualized screening for BCRP expression and activity may represent a useful tool for prediction of HY-mediated photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) or PDT effectiveness.", "journal": "Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie", "date": "2018-12-16", "authors": ["RastislavJend\u017eelovsk\u00fd", "ZuzanaJend\u017eelovsk\u00e1", "BarboraKuch\u00e1rov\u00e1", "PeterFedoro\u010dko"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biopha.2018.11.084"}

Surface supervision accuracy relies on the characteristics of surface region. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based automatic region-of-interest (ROI) selection method was proposed to select an optimal surface ROI for DIBH surface monitoring. The curvature entropy and the normal of each vertex on the breast cancer patient surface were calculated and formed as representative maps for ROI selection learning. 900 ROIs were randomly extracted from each patient's surface representative map, and the corresponding rigid ROI registration errors (REs) were calculated. The VGG-16 (a 16-layer network structure developed by Visual Geometry Group(VGG) from University of Oxford) pre-trained on a large natural image database ImageNet were fine-tuned using 27 thousand extracted ROIs and the corresponding REs from thirty patients. The RE prediction accuracy of the trained model was validated on additional ten patients. Satisfactory RE predictive accuracies were achieved with the root mean square error (RMSE)/mean absolute error (MAE) smaller than 1\u2009mm/0.7\u2009mm in translations and 0.45\u00b0/0.35\u00b0 in rotations, respectively.

{"title": "Ex vivo treatment of prostate tumor tissue recapitulates in vivo therapy response.", "abstract": "In vitro models of prostate cancer (PCa) are not always reliable to evaluate anticancer treatment efficacy. This limitation may be overcome by using viable tumor slice material. Here we report on the establishment of an optimized ex vivo method to culture tissue slices from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of prostate cancer (PCa), to assess responses to PCa treatments.\nThree PDX models were used that are characterized by different androgen receptor (AR) expression and different homology directed DNA repair capacities, due to a breast cancer associated two (BRCA2) wild-type or mutated status. Tumors were removed from mice, sliced using a vibratome and cultured for a maximum of 6 days. To test the sensitivity to androgen antagonist, tumor slices from the AR-expressing and AR-negative PDX tumors were treated with the anti-androgen enzalutamide. For sensitivity to DNA repair intervention, tumors slices from BRCA2 wild-type and mutated PDXs were treated with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibitor olaparib. Treatment response in these tumor slices was determined by measuring slice morphology, cell proliferation, apoptosis, AR expression level, and secretion of prostate specific antigen (PSA).\nWe compared various culture conditions (support materials, growth media, and use of a 3D smooth rocking platform) to define the optimal condition to maintain tissue viability and proliferative capacity up to least 6 days. Under optimized conditions, enzalutamide treatment significantly decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced AR-expression and PSA secretion of AR-expressing tumor slices compared to AR-negative slices, that did not respond to the intervention. Olaparib treatment significantly increased cell death in BRCA2 mutated tumors slices as compared to slices from BRCA2 wild type tumors.\nEx vivo treatment of PCa PDX tumor slices with enzalutamide and olaparib recapitulates responses previously observed in vivo.

Over 230 variables were extracted spanning the following variable segments: patient demographics, medical/surgical history, tumor characteristics, RT treatment history, and AEs tracked using CTCAEv4.0. Treatment failure was extracted algorithmically by searching posttreatment encounters for evidence of local, nodal, or distant failure. Individual models were trained using decision trees, logistic regression, random forests, and boosted decision trees to predict treatment failures and AEs. Models were fit on 75% of the data and evaluated for probability calibration and area under the ROC curve (AUC) on the remaining test set. The impact of each variable segment was assessed by retraining without the segment and measuring change in AUC (\u0394AUC).\nAll AUC values were statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Two out of eight RET fusions (NCOA4-RET and a novel RASGEF1A-RET fusion) and RET amplification were functionally characterized and shown to activate RET kinase and drive signaling through MAPK and PI3K pathways. These fusions and RET amplification can induce transformation of non-tumorigenic cells, support xenograft tumor formation, and render sensitivity to RET inhibition.

There is an urgent need for effective therapies for patients with TNBC. Recent findings confirm the important role of factors related to the immune system in the clinical outcome and response to treatment of TNBC patients. Avelumab selectively binds to PDL1, and competitively blocks its interaction with anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies. Unlike anti-PD-1 antibodies, which target T-cells, avelumab targets tumor cells, and is therefore expected to have fewer side effects, including a lower risk of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs). Uncertainties remain regarding a potential synergy resulting in increased toxicities by combining radiotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Effects of concomitant ICIs with thoracic radiotherapy on pulmonary toxicities is not currently known. There are no published data available on the effects of combining anti-PD-L1 with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for BC in a clinical setting.

{"title": "A nanoparticle-incorporated STING activator enhances antitumor immunity in PD-L1-insensitive models of triple-negative breast cancer.", "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has few therapeutic options, and alternative approaches are urgently needed. Stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is becoming an exciting target for therapeutic adjuvants. However, STING resides inside the cell, and the intracellular delivery of CDNs, such as cGAMP, is required for the optimal activation of STING. We show that liposomal nanoparticle-delivered cGAMP (cGAMP-NP) activates STING more effectively than soluble cGAMP. These particles induce innate and adaptive host immune responses to preexisting tumors in both orthotopic and genetically engineered models of basal-like TNBC. cGAMP-NPs also reduce melanoma tumor load, with limited responsivity to anti-PD-L1. Within the tumor microenvironment, cGAMP-NPs direct both mouse and human macrophages (M), reprograming from protumorigenic M2-like phenotype toward M1-like phenotype; enhance MHC and costimulatory molecule expression; reduce M2 biomarkers; increase IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells; augment tumor apoptosis; and increase CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Activated T cells are required for tumor suppression, as their depletion reduces antitumor activity. Importantly, cGAMP-NPs prevent the formation of secondary tumors, and a single dose is sufficient to inhibit TNBC. These data suggest that a minimal system comprised of cGAMP-NP alone is sufficient to modulate the tumor microenvironment to effectively control PD-L1-insensitive TNBC.", "journal": "JCI insight", "date": "2018-11-16", "authors": ["NingCheng", "RebekahWatkins-Schulz", "Robert DJunkins", "Cl\u00e9ment NDavid", "Brandon MJohnson", "Stephanie AMontgomery", "Kevin JPeine", "David BDarr", "HongYuan", "Karen PMcKinnon", "QiLiu", "LeiMiao", "LeafHuang", "Eric MBachelder", "Kristy MAinslie", "Jenny P-YTing"], "doi": "10.1172/jci.insight.120638\n10.1056/NEJMoa1503093\n10.1056/NEJMoa1504030\n10.1038/nature14011\n10.1210/me.2010-0164\n10.1200/JCO.2015.64.8931\n10.1126/science.1252510\n10.1016/j.ccr.2013.02.013\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0280\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-1362\n10.1038/nnano.2017.52\n10.1016/j.celrep.2015.04.031\n10.1038/nri3133\n10.1126/science.1232458\n10.1073/pnas.1621363114\n10.1038/nrc.2016.108\n10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.068\n10.1038/nrd2110\n10.1016/j.it.2015.02.006\n10.1038/ni.1937\n10.4049/jimmunol.1402066\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203280\n10.1172/JCI69804\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.06.010\n10.1016/j.it.2011.12.001\n10.1111/j.1365-2249.2011.04515.x\n10.1016/j.celrep.2016.04.084\n10.1056/NEJMoa1200690\n10.1038/70932\n10.1084/jem.192.7.1027\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.26.021607.090331\n10.1038/nature19330\n10.1172/JCI80011\n10.1002/cncr.30258\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2017.43\n10.1186/s40425-018-0316-z\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0493\n10.1158/0008-5472.SABCS-09-2166\n10.1038/cmi.2014.83\n10.1002/eji.201344304\n10.1007/978-1-60327-360-2_13\n10.1073/pnas.91.23.11236\n10.1056/NEJMoa1103849\n10.1038/nature21349\n10.1093/annonc/mdv623\n10.1038/nature07317\n10.1016/j.immuni.2008.09.003\n10.1016/j.immuni.2014.10.017\n10.1002/ijc.2910220307\n10.1146/annurev.immunol.22.012703.104803\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.01.007\n10.1038/nrc1256\n10.1016/j.it.2015.02.004\n10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.014\n10.1038/ni.3117\n10.3109/08982100902838682\n10.1007/978-1-60327-360-2_25"}

There exist various advanced chemotherapy drugs for BC; however, chemotherapy drugs may result in brain damage during treatment. When a patient's brain is changed in response to chemo drugs, it is termed chemo-brain. In this study, we aimed to construct machine-learning models to detect the subtle alternations of the brain in postchemotherapy BC patients.\nNineteen BC patients undergoing chemotherapy and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for this study. Both groups underwent resting-state functional MRI and generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI).\nLogistic regression (LR) with GQI indices in standardized voxel-wise analysis, LR with mean regional homogeneity in regional summation analysis, decision tree classifier (CART) with generalized fractional anisotropy in voxel-wise analysis, and XGBoost (XGB) with normalized quantitative anisotropy had formidable performances in classifying subjects into a chemo-brain group or an HC group. Classifying the brain MRIs of HC and postchemotherapy patients by conducting leave-one-out cross-validation resulted in the highest accuracy of 84%, which was attained by LR, CART, and XGB with multiple feature sets.\nIn our study, we constructed the machine-learning models that were able to identify chemo-brains from normal brains.

Overexpression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine in the tumor microenvironment has been demonstrated in numerous tumors including breast cancer. Tumor cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts are the major sources of IL-6 secretion in the tumor microenvironment. Several studies have demonstrated the immunopathogenic function of IL-6 and its signaling in the tumor growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance in the breast cancer.

{"title": "Prior to Initiation of Chemotherapy, Can We Predict Breast Tumor Response? Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks Approach Using a Breast MRI Tumor Dataset.", "abstract": "We hypothesize that convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be used to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response using a breast MRI tumor dataset prior to initiation of chemotherapy. An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of our database from January 2009 to June 2016 identified 141 locally advanced breast cancer patients who (1) underwent breast MRI prior to the initiation of NAC, (2) successfully completed adriamycin/taxane-based NAC, and (3) underwent surgical resection with available final surgical pathology data. Patients were classified into three groups based on their NAC response confirmed on final surgical pathology: complete (group 1), partial (group 2), and no response/progression (group 3). A total of 3107 volumetric slices of 141 tumors were evaluated. Breast tumor was identified on first T1 postcontrast dynamic images and underwent 3D segmentation. CNN consisted of ten convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and dropout of 50% after a fully connected layer. Dropout, augmentation, and L2 regularization were implemented to prevent overfitting of data. Non-linear functions were modeled by a rectified linear unit (ReLU). Batch normalization was used between the convolutional and ReLU layers to limit drift of layer activations during training. A three-class neoadjuvant prediction model was evaluated (group 1, group 2, or group 3). The CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 88% in three-class prediction of neoadjuvant treatment response. Three-class prediction discriminating one group from the other two was analyzed. Group 1 had a specificity of 95.1%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1%, sensitivity of 73.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5%, and accuracy of 87.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6%. Group 2 (partial response) had a specificity of 91.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3%, sensitivity of 82.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7%, and accuracy of 87.7%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6%.

For each lesion, 23 features were extracted: qualitative T2-weighted and DCE-MRI features according to BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System), quantitative pharmacokinetic DCE features (mean plasma flow, volume distribution, mean transit time), and DWI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. To apply machine learning to mpMRI, 8 classifiers including linear support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, random forests, stochastic gradient descent, decision tree, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to rank the features. Histopathologic residual cancer burden (RCB) class (with RCB 0 being a pCR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were used as the standards of reference. Classification accuracy with area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) was assessed using all the extracted qualitative and quantitative features for pCR as defined by RCB class, RFS, and DSS using recursive feature elimination. To overcome overfitting, 4-fold cross-validation was used.\nMachine learning with mpMRI achieved stable performance as shown by mean classification accuracies for the prediction of RCB class (AUC, 0.86) and DSS (AUC, 0.92) based on XGBoost and the prediction of RFS (AUC, 0.83) with logistic regression. The XGBoost classifier achieved the most stable performance with high accuracies compared with other classifiers. The most relevant features for the prediction of RCB class were as follows: changes in lesion size, complete pattern of shrinkage, and mean transit time on DCE-MRI; minimum ADC on DWI; and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted imaging. The most relevant features for prediction of RFS were as follows: volume distribution, mean plasma flow, and mean transit time; DCE-MRI lesion size; minimum, maximum, and mean ADC with DWI. The most relevant features for prediction of DSS were as follows: lesion size, volume distribution, and mean plasma flow on DCE-MRI, and maximum ADC with DWI.\nMachine learning with mpMRI of the breast enables early prediction of pCR to NAC as well as survival outcomes in breast cancer patients with high accuracy and thus may provide valuable predictive information to guide treatment decisions.", "journal": "Investigative radiology", "date": "2018-10-26", "authors": ["AmirhessamTahmassebi", "Georg JWengert", "Thomas HHelbich", "ZsuzsannaBago-Horvath", "SousanAlaei", "RupertBartsch", "PeterDubsky", "PascalBaltzer", "PaolaClauser", "PanagiotisKapetas", "Elizabeth AMorris", "AnkeMeyer-Baese", "KatjaPinker"], "doi": "10.1097/RLI.0000000000000518"}

Newly diagnostic OS patients benefit from the standard therapy including surgical resection plus radiotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (MAP chemotherapy: high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin and cisplatin). However, tumor recurrence and metastasis give rise to a sharp decline of the 5-year overall survival rate in OS patients. Little improvement has been made for decades, urging the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. ErbB receptor family including EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4, being important to the activation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, are potential targets for OS treatment. Genetic aberrations (amplification, overexpression, mutation and altered splicing) of ErbB are essential to the growth, apoptosis, motility and metastasis in a variety of cancers. Overexpression of ErbB family is associated with the poor prognosis of cancer patients. A number of monoclonal antibodies or inhibitors specific for ErbB family have entered clinical trials in a range of solid tumors including breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma and sarcoma.

Overall response rates in advanced breast cancer are low, but the responses are remarkably durable. A deeper understanding of the biology of the interaction between cancer and immune cells is required to both develop biomarkers that more accurately predict response to therapy and identify effective immunotherapy-based combination strategies that can enhance the immunogenicity of biologically \"cold\" tumors.

{"title": "Ultrasmall targeted nanoparticles with engineered antibody fragments for imaging detection of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.", "abstract": "Controlling the biodistribution of nanoparticles upon intravenous injection is the key to achieving target specificity. One of the impediments in nanoparticle-based tumor\u00a0targeting is the inability to limit the trafficking of nanoparticles to liver and other organs leading to smaller accumulated amounts in tumor tissues, particularly via passive targeting. Here we overcome both these challenges by designing nanoparticles that combine the specificity of antibodies with favorable particle biodistribution profiles, while not exceeding the threshold for renal filtration as a combined vehicle. To that end, ultrasmall silica nanoparticles are functionalized with anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) single-chain variable fragments to exhibit high tumor-targeting efficiency and efficient renal clearance.

Mammography is the most effective and efficient technique used for detection of breast cancer in women and also to improve the breast cancer prognosis. The numbers of images need to be examined by the radiologists, the resulting may be misdiagnosis due to human errors by visual Fatigue. In order to avoid human errors, Computer Aided Diagnosis is implemented. In Computer Aided Diagnosis system, number of processing and analysis of an image is done by the suitable algorithm. Methods: This paper proposed a technique to aid radiologist to diagnosis breast cancer using Shearlet transform image enhancement method. Similar to wavelet filter, Shearlet coefficients are more directional sensitive than wavelet filters which helps detecting the cancer cells particularly for small contours. After enhancement of an image, segmentation algorithm is applied to identify the suspicious region. Result: Many features are extracted and utilized to classify the mammographic images into harmful or harmless tissues using neural network classifier.

{"title": "4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) enhances the sensitivity of human breast cancer cells to adriamycin as a specific HDAC6 inhibitor by promoting HIPK2/p53 pathway.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is reported a very complex disease along with heterogeneous morphological characteristics and unrelated clinical behavior, and is a leading cancer among female. Nevertheless, chemo-resistance is frequently observed. Adriamycin (ADM) is a always employed drug to treat clinical breast cancer. However, strong resistance to ADM limited its clinical efficacy. Deregulation of HDAC6 activity is linked to various diseases including cancer resulting in accumulating interest for developing HDAC6 inhibitors. In the present study, for the first time, we found that 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), as histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor, could successfully reverse ADM resistance in human breast cancer cells. 4-HBA significantly promoted the anticancer effect of ADM on apoptosis induction, as evidenced by the increased expressions of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, which was associated with the promotion p53 and homeodomain interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) expressions in ADM-resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of ADM on drug-resistant breast cancer cells was accelerated by 4-HBA through increasing the number of cells distributed in G2/M phase of cell cycle arrest. Inhibiting HIPK2/p53 pathway could abolish 4-HBA/ADM co-treatment-induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Importantly, HDAC6 expressions were also significantly down-regulated in ADM-resistance breast cancer cells co-treated with ADM and 4-HBA. Additionally, 4-HBA clearly potentiated the anticancer role of ADM in the MCF-7 breast cancer animal model with low toxicity. Therefore, 4-HBA could be applied as an effective HDAC6 inhibitor to reverse human breast cancer resistance.

Many factors influence the treatment decision, including tumor characteristics, previous treatment and tumor burden in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\nThis present review summarizes the new treatment strategies and the chemotherapeutic agents currently available in the management of metastatic breast cancer with bone metastases.\nPatients with bone metastases more often have hormone receptor-positive tumours. Although new treatment agents for metastatic breast cancer have been investigated, endocrine therapy is still considered as the treatment of choice for patients with bone metastases although chemotherapy still has an important place. In recent years, new chemotherapeutic agents such as etirinotecan and nab-paclitaxel have been established though there are few studies that have looked at particular types of metastases. In the last decade, therapies for bone metastasis resistant to endocrine therapy have predominantly focused on radiotherapy, surgical resection, chemotherapy, bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals and targeted therapeutics.

Thus, this study provides evidence of a critical role of SRGN in metastatic progression of CRC.\nOur results indicated that SRGN overexpression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in CRC specimens. SRGN overexpression promoted CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro; however, SRGN depletion exhibited contrasting effects. Mechanistic investigations revealed that HIF-1\u03b1 regulated SRGN transcription via physically binding to a hypoxia response element in its promoter region.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that dysregulated HIF-1\u03b1/SRGN signaling promotes CRC progression and metastasis.

Clonogenic assays, sphere formation\u00a0and cell death ELISA were performed to study the sensitising effect of palbociclib on radiation-induced cytotoxicity. Signal alteration in DSB repair pathways was examined by Western blot analysis. Finally, we evaluated the in\u00a0vivo anti-cancer activity and the associated molecular events of the combination therapy in a preclinical HCC xenograft model.\nPalbociclib affected the kinetics of DNA repair and enhanced the radiation sensitivity of HCC and CCA cells. Importantly, we found that palbociclib inhibits ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, the key upstream kinase responding to RT-induced DSBs. Furthermore, we showed that the inhibitory effect of palbociclib on RT-induced ATM kinase activation is mediated by protein phosphatase 5 (PP5).

{"title": "Medical breast ultrasound image segmentation by machine learning.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, which alone accounts for 30% all new cancer diagnoses for women, posing a threat to women's health. Segmentation of breast ultrasound images into functional tissues can aid tumor localization, breast density measurement, and assessment of treatment response, which is important to the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer. However, manually segmenting the ultrasound images, which is skill and experience dependent, would lead to a subjective diagnosis; in addition, it is time-consuming for radiologists to review hundreds of clinical images. Therefore, automatic segmentation of breast ultrasound images into functional tissues has received attention in recent years, amidst the more numerous studies of detection and segmentation of masses. In this paper, we propose to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting breast ultrasound images into four major tissues: skin, fibroglandular tissue, mass, and fatty tissue, on three-dimensional (3D) breast ultrasound images.

{"title": "Stromal PTEN determines mammary epithelial response to radiotherapy.", "abstract": "The importance of the tumor-associated stroma in cancer progression is clear. However, it remains uncertain whether early events in the stroma are capable of initiating breast tumorigenesis. Here, we show that in the mammary glands of non-tumor bearing mice, stromal-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) deletion invokes radiation-induced genomic instability in neighboring epithelium. In these animals, a single dose of whole-body radiation causes focal mammary lobuloalveolar hyperplasia through paracrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, and EGFR inhibition abrogates these cellular changes. By analyzing human tissue, we discover that stromal PTEN is lost in a subset of normal breast samples obtained from reduction mammoplasty, and is predictive of recurrence in breast cancer patients. Combined, these data indicate that diagnostic or therapeutic chest radiation may predispose patients with decreased stromal PTEN expression to secondary breast cancer, and that prophylactic EGFR inhibition may reduce this risk.", "journal": "Nature communications", "date": "2018-07-19", "authors": ["Gina MSizemore", "SubhasreeBalakrishnan", "Katie AThies", "Anisha MHammer", "Steven TSizemore", "Anthony JTrimboli", "Maria CCuiti\u00f1o", "Sarah ASteck", "GaryTozbikian", "Raleigh DKladney", "NeelamShinde", "ManjusriDas", "DongjuPark", "SarmilaMajumder", "ShivaKrishnan", "LianboYu", "Soledad AFernandez", "ArnabChakravarti", "Peter GShields", "Julia RWhite", "Lisa DYee", "Thomas JRosol", "ThomasLudwig", "MoragPark", "GustavoLeone", "Michael COstrowski"], "doi": "10.1038/s41467-018-05266-6\n10.1172/JCI57100\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1038/nature08486\n10.1038/nrc1819\n10.1016/0092-8674(88)90184-5\n10.1038/ncb2396\n10.1126/science.1090922\n10.1038/nature03096\n10.1038/nrc1877\n10.1073/pnas.0401064101\n10.1038/nature04372\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-2148\n10.1186/bcr3593\n10.1186/gb-2007-8-5-r76\n10.1038/onc.2014.475\n10.1016/j.ccr.2005.01.009\n10.1126/science.1236188\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.11.042\n10.1038/ni0707-665\n10.1073/pnas.161269798\n10.1038/35052073\n10.1038/sj.onc.1205146\n10.1038/nrc2127\n10.18632/oncotarget.2259\n10.1215/15228517-2008-081\n10.1016/S0014-4827(02)00101-5\n10.1023/A:1009560330359\n10.1038/nbt1358\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3559\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00924.x\n10.1080/15592294.2015.1121362\n10.1007/s10911-013-9272-x\n10.1038/nrc3069\n10.1056/NEJMoa071167\n10.3121/cmr.2008.825\n10.1200/JCO.2008.18.1370\n10.1093/annonc/mdn005\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0242\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2384\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4853\n10.1016/j.radonc.2013.05.006\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1606\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70213-X\n10.1038/nrclinonc.2013.41\n10.1056/NEJM199203193261201\n10.1016/S0167-8140(01)00369-3\n10.1056/NEJM199603213341201\n10.1093/jnci/djq238\n10.1093/jnci/85.1.25\n10.1200/JCO.2013.54.4601\n10.1001/jama.290.4.465\n10.1056/NEJM198801143180203\n10.1016/S1470-2045(03)01033-7\n10.2307/3577890\n10.1097/00007632-200008150-00009\n10.1093/jnci/77.3.689\n10.1093/jnci/85.20.1679\n10.1016/j.rpor.2011.06.001\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1949\n10.1038/onc.2011.439\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203277"}
{"title": "Framework of Computer Aided Diagnosis Systems for Cancer Classification Based on Medical Images.", "abstract": "Early detection of cancer can increase patients' survivability and treatment options. Medical images such as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and microscopic images are the common method for cancer diagnosis. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been used to help physicians in cancer diagnosis so that the diagnosis accuracy can be improved. CAD can help in decreasing missed cancer lesions due to physician fatigue, reducing the burden of workload and data overloading, and decreasing variability of inter- and intra-readers of images. In this research, a framework of CAD systems for cancer diagnosis based on medical images has been proposed. The proposed work helps physicians in detection of suspicion regions using different medical images modalities and in classifying the detected suspicious regions as normal or abnormal with the highest possible accuracy. The proposed framework of CAD system consists of four stages which are: preprocessing, segmentation of regions of interest, feature extraction and selection, and finally classification. In this research, the framework has been applied on blood smear images to diagnose the cases as normal or abnormal for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cases. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has been used to select the subsets of features from the features extracted from segmented cell parts which can maximize the classification performance as possible. Different classifiers which are Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied. The framework has been yielding promising results which reached 96.25% accuracy, 97.3% sensitivity, and 95.35% specificity using decision tree classifier.", "journal": "Journal of medical systems", "date": "2018-07-12", "authors": ["Enas M FEl Houby"], "doi": "10.1007/s10916-018-1010-x"}

It is well known that anti-estrogen therapy (AET), especially aromatase inhibitors (AI), is associated with rapid bone loss and thus increases the risk of osteoporosis. This study characterizes patterns and predictors of receiving guideline-recommended bone densitometry (BD) screening at AET initiation.\nA retrospective cohort study (1998-2012) of all women \u226565\u202fyears of age initiating AET was designed using claims data from Quebec's universal health care. Associations with BD screening were estimated using a generalized estimating equations regression model, adjusting for clustering of patients within physicians.\nAmong 16,480 women initiating AET, 36.1% received a baseline BD. Among AI users, the rate was 58.4%. In the multivariate analysis, age, lower socioeconomic status, tamoxifen use, lack of periodic health exam and having a general practitioner as the AET prescriber were associated with lower odds of BD screening. In terms of quality of care-related variables, lack of guideline-appropriate radiotherapy (OR: 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57-0.83), or chemotherapy consideration (0.82 (95% CI, 0.71-0.94)) and non-adherence to AET (0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.84)) were associated with lower odds of receiving BD screening. Women diagnosed with BC after 2003 had significantly better odds of being screened.\nDespite an increase in rates since 2003, BD screening remains suboptimal, especially for women at higher risk of osteoporosis.

The effects of MASTL depletion with siRNAs were evaluated in various breast cancer cells or normal cells. Various methods, including cell viability, cell cycle, soft agar, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, PP2A activity, live image, and sphere forming assay, were used in this study.\nThis study showed the oncosuppressive mechanism of MASTL targeting that promotes mitotic catastrophe through PP2A activation selectively in breast cancer cells.

The depletion of MASTL reduced the oncogenic properties of breast cancer cells with high MASTL expression, but did not affect the viability of non-transformed normal cells with low MASTL expression. With regard to the underlying mechanism, we found that MASTL inhibition caused mitotic catastrophe through PP2A activation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, MASTL depletion enhanced the radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells with increased PP2A activity.

In this study we found that miR-205 expression level is extremely low in basal mesenchymal-like highly migratory and invasive TNBC cells. Stably re-expressing miR-205 in TNBC cells significantly reduced their migration, invasion capability and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like property. Nude mouse orthotopic mammary xenograft tumor model study revealed that miR-205 re-expression greatly decreases TNBC tumor growth and abolishes spontaneous lung metastasis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that miR-205 inhibits TNBC cell metastatic traits and tumor metastasis by down-regulating integrin \u03b15 (ITGA5). Moreover, ITGA5 knockout using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique achieved the same strong inhibitory effect on TNBC cell CSC-like property and tumor metastasis as re-expressing miR-205 did. Further mechanistic studies indicated that ITGA5 down-regulation by miR-205 re-expression impairs TNBC cell metastatic traits by inhibiting the Src/Vav2/Rac1 pathway.

In normal breast human tissue, PRA and PRB are expressed in equimolar ratios, but isoform ratio is altered during malignant progression, usually leading to high PRA:PRB ratios. We took advantage of a transgenic mouse model where PRA isoform is predominant (PRA transgenics) and identified the key transcriptional events and associated pathways underlying the preneoplastic phenotype in mammary glands of PRA transgenics as compared with normal wild-type littermates.\nThe transcriptomic profiles of PRA transgenics and wild-type mammary glands were generated using microarray technology.

Human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) were selected and treated with radiation of different doses. Cells were treated with Gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI) to analyze the effects of GSI on the Notch signaling, which were detected by Immunofluorescence assay, RT-qPCR, and Western blot analysis. Besides, Transwell assay, Scratch test, colony formation assay, MTT assay, and flow cytometry were conducted to show the effects of GSI on the invasion and migration, survival fraction, cell viability, and apoptosis of MCF-7 and T47D cells after radiation therapy. Moreover, cell transfection with a dominant negative mutant of RBPJ, the key transcription factor of Notch signaling pathway, were also applied to show the inhibition of Notch signaling pathway. Initially, we found that the 4\u2009Gy radiation activated Notch signaling pathway, and enhanced the invasion and migration of MCF-7 and T47D cells. However, GSI inhibited the Notch signaling pathway, and reversed the enhancement of radiation on the migration and invasion, promoted the enhancement of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells induced by radiation. Except that, we also determined that GSI and dnRBPJ suppressed the upregulation of Notch signaling after radiation therapy.

Primary objective was antiproliferative response defined as a natural logarithm of Ki67 expression at day 15 below 1. Secondary end points were subgroups analyses and safety. Exploratory analyses included search for predictive biomarkers. Immunostainings (Ki67, RB, pRB, p16, pAKT, pER, pCDK2, CyclinD1), FISH (CCND1) and gene expression (GE) arrays were carried out at baseline and at surgery.

Brain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancer patients usually constitute the first site of recurrence.

The patient was hospitalized for a cough with blood-tinged sputum, dysphagia, and blurred vision in the left eye at the age of 57.\nOn evaluation, laboratory findings detected the elevated serum tumor markers of CA12-5, CA15-3, NSE, and Cyfra21-1. The imaging showed left lung metastase, multiple lymph node metastases, and small suspected metastases in the both sides of parietal lobes. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed choroidal occupying lesion of the left side which indicates secondary metastasis and retinal detachment. Combined with the pathological finding via fiberoptic bronchoscopic biopsy, the patient was clinically diagnosed with a late distant recurrence of breast carcinoma.\nThe patient received oral endocrine therapy of letrozole, but she refused chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other topical treatments.\nAt the 3-month follow-up visit, the multiple lesions of the left lung and lymph nodes had partially regressed, and the lesion of right parietal lobe had disappeared. The patient's clinical symptoms, such as blood-tinged sputum and dysphagia, had significantly improved.\nWe have described this case and reviewed the relevant literature concerning late distant recurrence of breast carcinoma.

Reprogrammed glucose metabolism is one of the important hallmarks of cancer that facilitates cancer cell survival, proliferation and chemoresistance. However, the precise fate of glucose metabolism and its role in therapy responsiveness in cancers remains largely unexplored.\nThe glycolytic phenotype of doxorubicin (ADR)-resistant breast cancer cells and their parental cells was assessed by measuring glucose uptake, lactate release, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Protein expression was detected by Western blotting analysis and mRNA expression was detected using q-PCR. Cell survival ratio was determined by the cell counting kit 8 assay. The role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) in glycolysis, chemoresistance, and the underlying mechanisms were studied by using gene expression microarray and short hairpin RNA-mediated gene knockdown.\nWe found that glycolytic flux are increased in two doxorubicin (ADR)-resistant breast cancer cell lines compared with their parental wild type cells, as demonstrated by increased glucose uptake, lactate release, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). By gene expression microarray, we identified FGFR4 as a critical modulator of ADR resistance and enhanced glucose metabolism. Genetic silencing of FGFR4 increased the chemosensitivity and suppressed the enhanced glycolytic flux in ADR-resistant cells. Mechanistically, activation of FGFR4 signaling in ADR-resistant cells led to the phosphorylation of FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) and further activated the downstream MAPK/ERK signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR4-FRS2-ERK signaling pathway significantly blocked the chemoresistant and glycolytic phenotypes of ADR-resistant cells.\nOur findings suggest that high levels of FGFR4 can increase glucose metabolism and lead to chemoresistance in breast cancer and reveal the mechanistic basis for targeting FGFR4 as a therapeutic opportunity for chemoresistant tumors.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2018-05-16", "authors": ["MinXu", "ShuzhengChen", "WeibinYang", "XueCheng", "YaniYe", "JiantingMao", "XuluWu", "LiHuang", "JiansongJi"], "doi": "10.1159/000489759"}

Their embryonic stem-like signature is associated with poor clinical outcome. In the present study, the function of octamer-binding transcription factor\u00a04 (Oct4), an embryonic stem cell factor, in the resistance of BCSCs to IR was investigated. Mammosphere cells exhibited increased expression of stemness-associated genes, including Oct4 and sex\u2011determining region Y\u2011box\u00a02 (Sox2), and were more resistant to IR compared with serum-cultured monolayer cells. IR\u2011resistant MCF7 cells also exhibited significantly increased expression of Oct4. To investigate the possible involvement of Oct4 in IR resistance of breast cancer cells, cells were transfected with Oct4. Ectopic expression of Oct4 increased the clonogenic survival of MCF7 cells following IR, which was reversed by treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Oct4. Oct4 expression decreased phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX) focus formation and suppressed IR\u2011induced premature senescence in these cells.

{"title": "The senescence-associated secretory phenotype is potentiated by feedforward regulatory mechanisms involving Zscan4 and TAK1.", "abstract": "The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) can be provoked by side effects of therapeutic agents, fueling advanced complications including cancer resistance. However, the intracellular signal network supporting initiation and development of the SASP driven by treatment-induced damage remains unclear. Here we report that the transcription factor Zscan4 is elevated for expression by an ATM-TRAF6-TAK1 axis during the acute DNA damage response and enables a long term SASP in human stromal cells. Further, TAK1 activates p38 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR to support the persistent SASP signaling. As TAK1 is implicated in dual feedforward mechanisms to orchestrate the SASP development, pharmacologically targeting TAK1 deprives cancer cells of resistance acquired from treatment-damaged stromal cells in vitro and substantially promotes tumour regression in vivo.

{"title": "Enhanced targeting of triple-negative breast carcinoma and malignant melanoma by photochemical internalization of CSPG4-targeting immunotoxins.", "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and malignant melanoma are highly aggressive cancers that widely express the cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4/NG2). CSPG4 plays an important role in tumor cell growth and survival and promotes chemo- and radiotherapy resistance, suggesting that CSPG4 is an attractive target in cancer therapy. In the present work, we applied the drug delivery technology photochemical internalization (PCI) in combination with the novel CSPG4-targeting immunotoxin 225.28-saporin as an efficient and specific strategy to kill aggressive TNBC and amelanotic melanoma cells. Light-activation of the clinically relevant photosensitizer TPCS2a (fimaporfin) and 225.28-saporin was found to act in a synergistic manner, and was superior to both PCI of saporin and PCI-no-drug (TPCS2a + light only) in three TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and SUM149) and two BRAFV600E mutated malignant melanoma cell lines (Melmet 1 and Melmet 5). The cytotoxic effect was highly dependent on the light dose and expression of CSPG4 since no enhanced cytotoxicity of PCI of 225.28-saporin compared to PCI of saporin was observed in the CSPG4-negative MCF-7 cells. The PCI of a smaller, and clinically relevant CSPG4-targeting toxin (scFvMEL-rGel) validated the CSPG4-targeting concept in vitro and induced a strong inhibition of tumor growth in the amelanotic melanoma xenograft A-375 model. In conclusion, the combination of the drug delivery technology PCI and CSPG4-targeting immunotoxins is an efficient, specific and light-controlled strategy for the elimination of aggressive cells of TNBC and malignant melanoma origin.

{"title": "Obesity promotes resistance to anti-VEGF therapy in breast cancer by up-regulating IL-6 and potentially FGF-2.", "abstract": "Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has failed to improve survival in patients with breast cancer (BC). Potential mechanisms of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy include the up-regulation of alternative angiogenic and proinflammatory factors. Obesity is associated with hypoxic adipose tissues, including those in the breast, resulting in increased production of some of the aforementioned factors. Hence, we hypothesized that obesity could contribute to anti-VEGF therapy's lack of efficacy. We found that BC patients with obesity harbored increased systemic concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and/or fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and their tumor vasculature was less sensitive to anti-VEGF treatment. Mouse models revealed that obesity impairs the effects of anti-VEGF on angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. In one murine BC model, obesity was associated with increased IL-6 production from adipocytes and myeloid cells within tumors. IL-6 blockade abrogated the obesity-induced resistance to anti-VEGF therapy in primary and metastatic sites by directly affecting tumor cell proliferation, normalizing tumor vasculature, alleviating hypoxia, and reducing immunosuppression. Similarly, in a second mouse model, where obesity was associated with increased FGF-2, normalization of FGF-2 expression by metformin or specific FGF receptor inhibition decreased vessel density and restored tumor sensitivity to anti-VEGF therapy in obese mice. Collectively, our data indicate that obesity fuels BC resistance to anti-VEGF therapy via the production of inflammatory and angiogenic factors.", "journal": "Science translational medicine", "date": "2018-03-16", "authors": ["JoaoIncio", "Jennifer ALigibel", "Daniel TMcManus", "PriyaSuboj", "KeehoonJung", "KosukeKawaguchi", "MatthiasPinter", "SubojBabykutty", "Shan MChin", "Trupti DVardam", "YuhuiHuang", "Nuh NRahbari", "SylvieRoberge", "DannieWang", "Igor LGomes-Santos", "Stefan BPuchner", "Christopher LSchlett", "UdoHoffmman", "MarekAncukiewicz", "Sara MTolaney", "Ian EKrop", "Dan GDuda", "YvesBoucher", "DaiFukumura", "Rakesh KJain"], "doi": "10.1126/scitranslmed.aag0945"}

This cohort included 29 triple-negative, 45 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, 36 luminal A, and 221 luminal B lesions. A set of 39 quantitative radiomic features, including morphologic, grayscale statistic, and texture features, were extracted from the segmented lesion area. Three binary classifications of the subtypes were performed: triple-negative vs non-triple-negative, HER2-enriched vs non-HER2-enriched, and luminal (A\u2009+\u2009B) vs nonluminal. The Naive Bayes machine learning scheme was employed for the classification, and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator method was used to select the most predictive features for the classifiers. Classification performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy.\nThe model that used the combination of both the craniocaudal and the mediolateral oblique view images achieved the overall best performance than using either of the two views alone, yielding an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (or accuracy) of 0.865 (0.796) for triple-negative vs non-triple-negative, 0.784 (0.748) for HER2-enriched vs non-HER2-enriched, and 0.752 (0.788) for luminal vs nonluminal subtypes. Twelve most predictive features were selected by the least absolute shrink age and selection operator method and four of them (ie, roundness, concavity, gray mean, and correlation) showed a statistical significance (P<\u2009.05) in the subtype classification.\nOur study showed that quantitative radiomic imaging features of breast tumor extracted from digital mammograms are associated with breast cancer subtypes.

{"title": "PLK1 Inhibition Radiosensitizes Breast Cancer Cells, but Shows Low Efficacy as Monotherapy or in Combination with other Cytotoxic Drugs.", "abstract": "Over the last decade, the inhibition of PLK1 has proven potent antiproliferative activity in vitro. However, the effectiveness of most synthetic targeted drugs has not yet been translated into clinics. Herein, we investigated the in vitro effects of two second-generation PLK1 inhibitors BI 6727 and GSK461364 in breast cancer cell lines as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs or ionizing radiation.\nCell survival was analyzed through XTT\u00ae, clonogenicity and caspase-3 activation assays were also studied, and drug interactions analyzed through a nonlinear regression of a sigmoid doseresponse model. Sensibilization to radiation was assessed through enhancement ratio calculation.\nMild effects on the viability of both cell lines tested (MCF-7 and Hs578T) were observed irrespective of the used PLK1 inhibitor. Alternatively, abrogation of PLK1 significantly reduced clonogenicity while effectively sensitized cells to ionizing radiation. Drug interactions showed dissimilar results with antagonistic effects with any drug combination in MCF-7 and clear synergic interactions between both PLK1 inhibitors and cisplatin, temozolomide or doxorubicin in Hs578T, which is TP53 mutated.\nTargeting kinases involved in mitotic checkpoints are expected to prevent mitotic exit and enhance chemosensitization. Nonetheless, despite overexpressing PLK1, in our model, expressive results after its inhibition were only seen through clonogenic assays or when BI 6727 and GSK461364 were combined with ionizing radiation. Disparate responses of cell lines to drug combinations might denote a partial reflection of the substantial differences in the vast spectrum of genetic, biological and epigenetic burden observed in breast cancer. In the near future, individual genomic/proteomic profiling will allow its further classification and will consent the initiation of novel strategies for therapy. Even though the future impact of PLK1-tailored treatment still needs validation, much more pre-clinical and clinical research for this kinase are warranted.", "journal": "Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry", "date": "2018-03-02", "authors": ["Mar\u00eda SolBrassesco", "Julia AlejandraPezuk", "Karina BezerraSalom\u00e3o", "Gabriela MolinariRoberto", "Carlos AlbertoScrideli", "Luiz GonzagaTone"], "doi": "10.2174/1871520618666180228155435"}

These polarized macrophages were co-cultured with IBC cells (SUM149, KPL4, MDA-IBC3, or SUM190) without direct contact for 24\u00a0hours, then subjected to irradiation (0, 2, 4, or 6\u00a0Gy). Interleukin (IL)4/IL13-induced activation of STAT6 signaling was measured by Western blotting of phospho-STAT6 (Tyr641), and expression of M2 polarization gene markers (CD206, fibronectin, and CCL22) was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\nExpression of M2 polarization markers was higher in M2-polarized macrophages after IL4/IL13 treatment than in control (M0) or M1-polarized macrophages. Co-culture of IBC cell lines with M1-polarized THP-1 macrophages mediated radiosensitivity of IBC cells, whereas co-culture with M2-polarized macrophages mediated radioresistance. Phosphopeptide mimetic PM37, targeting the SH2 domain of STAT6, prevented and reversed IL4/IL13-mediated STAT6 phosphorylation (Tyr641) and decreased the expression of M2 polarization markers. Pretreatment of M2-THP1 macrophages with PM37 reduced the radioresistance they induced in IBC cells after co-culture. Targeted proteomics analysis of IBC KPL4 cells using a kinase antibody array revealed induction of protein kinase C zeta (PRKCZ) in these cells only after co-culture with M2-THP1 macrophages, which was prevented by PM37 pretreatment. KPL4 cells with stable short hairpin\u00a0RNA knockdown of PRKCZ exhibited lower radioresistance after M2-THP1 co-culture.\nThese data suggest that inhibition of M2 polarization of macrophages by PM37 can prevent radioresistance of IBC by down-regulating PRKCZ.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2018-02-28", "authors": ["Omar MRahal", "Adam RWolfe", "Pijus KMandal", "RichardLarson", "SandaTin", "CristinaJimenez", "DadongZhang", "JanetHorton", "James MReuben", "John SMcMurray", "Wendy AWoodward"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.11.043"}

{"title": "Non-Invasive Radiofrequency Field Treatment of 4T1 Breast Tumors Induces T-cell Dependent Inflammatory Response.", "abstract": "Previous work using non-invasive radiofrequency field treatment (RFT) in cancer has demonstrated its therapeutic potential as it can increase intratumoral blood perfusion, localization of intravenously delivered drugs, and promote a hyperthermic intratumoral state. Despite the well-known immunologic benefits that febrile hyperthermia can induce, an investigation of how RFT could modulate the intra-tumoral immune microenvironment had not been\u00a0studied. Thus, using an established 4T1 breast cancer model in immune competent mice, we demonstrate that RFT induces a transient, localized, and T-cell dependent intratumoral inflammatory response. More specifically we show that multi- and singlet-dose RFT promote an increase in tumor volume in immune competent Balb/c mice, which does not occur in athymic nude models. Further leukocyte subset analysis at 24, 48, and 120\u2009hours after a single RFT show a rapid increase in tumoral trafficking of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells 24\u2009hours post-treatment. Additional serum cytokine analysis reveals an increase in numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with enhanced T-cell trafficking.

{"title": "Occurrence of pneumonitis following radiotherapy of breast cancer - A prospective study.", "abstract": "of this study is to determine the temporal resolution of therapy-induced pneumonitis, and to assess promoting factors in adjuvant treated patients with unilateral mammacarcinoma.\nA\u00a0total of 100\u00a0post-surgery patients were recruited. The cohort was treated by 2\u00a0field radiotherapy (2FRT; breast and chest wall, N\u202f=\u200975), 3\u00a0field radiotherapy (3FRT; + supraclavicular lymphatic region, N\u202f=\u20098), or with 4\u00a0field radiotherapy (4FRT; + parasternal lymphatic region, N\u202f=\u200917). Ninety-one patients received various systemic treatments prior to irradiation. Following an initial screening visit post-RT, two additional visits after 12 and 25 weeks were conducted including radiographic examination. In addition, general anamnesis and the co-medication were recorded. The endpoint was reached as soon as a pneumonitis was developed or at maximum of six months post-treatment.\nA pneumonitis incidence of 13% was determined. Of 91 patients with prior systemic therapy, 11 patients developed pneumonitis. Smoking history and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appeared to be positive predictors, whereas past pneumonia clearly promoted pneumonitis. Further pneumonitis-promoting predictors are represented by the applied field extensions (2\u00a0field radiotherapy [2FRT]\u202f<\u202f3\u00a0field radiotherapy [3FRT]\u202f<\u202f4\u00a0field radiotherapy [4FRT]) and the type of combined initial systemic therapies. As a consequence, all of the three patients in the study cohort treated with 4FRT and initial chemotherapy combined with anti-hormone and antibody protocols developed pneumonitis. A\u00a0combination of the hormone antagonists tamoxifen and goserelin might enhance the risk for pneumonitis. Remarkably, none of the 11 patients co-medicated with statins suffered from pneumonitis.\nThe rapidly increasing use of novel systemic therapy schedules combined with radiotherapy (RT) needs more prospective studies with larger cohorts. Our results indicate that contribution to pneumonitis occurrence of various (neo)adjuvant therapy approaches followed by RT is of minor relevance, whereas mean total lung doses of >10 Gy escalate the risk of lung tissue complications. The validity of potential inhibitors of therapy-induced pneumonitis as observed for statin co-medication should further be investigated in future trials.\nErfassen von therapieinduzierten Pneumonitisf\u00e4llen und von beg\u00fcnstigenden Faktoren bei adjuvant bestrahlten Patientinnen mit einseitigem Mammakarzinom.\nEs wurden 100 Patientinnen post-resektiv eingeschlossen.

We have evaluated the clinical utility to use available inhibitors of the HER family in the context of ERBB3 mutations.\nIn this study, we have selected patients with somatic ERBB3 alterations detected in their tumours from the molecular screening programs running at our institution. Techniques used for molecular screening were targeted next generation sequencing, comparative genomic hybridisation and/or whole exome sequencing on fresh frozen tumour biopsies.\nOn the 844 patients with a molecular portrait of their tumours, 31 (3.7%) had a somatic mutation of ERBB3. Overall, 9 patients received available inhibitors of HER family, including trastuzumab and/or lapatinib or afatinib. Sixteen patients received other molecularly targeted agents, including the Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), the Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase (PI3K) or NOTCH inhibitors or chemotherapy, and 4 patients failed being treated. Thirteen different histological subtypes were affected by ERBB3 mutations; top ones were colorectal carcinomas (6 patients), non-small cell lung cancers (4 patients, including a squamous cell carcinoma), head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (3 patients) and breast carcinomas (3 patients). The presence of a mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the ERBB3/HER3 protein detected in four patients' tumours was significantly related to good progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.18, p value\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and overall survival (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.19, p value\u00a0=\u00a00.03) in univariate analysis.

Outcomes include breast cancers diagnosed, breast cancer deaths averted, breast cancer mortality reduction, false-positive mammograms, benign biopsies, and overdiagnosis. The Mammo OUTPuT tool displays these outcomes for combinations of age at screening initiation (every year from 40 to 49), annual versus biennial interval, lifetime versus 10-year horizon, and breast density, compared to waiting to start biennial screening at age 50 and continuing to 74. The tool was piloted by decision makers (n = 16) who completed surveys.\nThe tool demonstrates that benefits in the 40s increase linearly with earlier initiation age, without a specific threshold age. Likewise, the harms of screening increase monotonically with earlier ages of initiation in the 40s. The tool also shows users how the balance of benefits and harms varies with breast density. Surveys revealed that 100% of users (16/16) liked the appearance of the site; 94% (15/16) found the tool helpful; and 94% (15/16) would recommend the tool to a colleague.\nThis tool synthesizes a representative subset of the most current CISNET (Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network) simulation model outcomes to provide policy makers with quantitative data on the benefits and harms of screening women in the 40s.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the radioprotective effects of bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1 in a murine model of pulmonary damage. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed in a rat model after 20\u2009Gy radiation of the right thorax. And histological evaluation and protein expressions of irradiated tissue were analyzed to confirm the potential anti-fibrosis effect of JQ1 and its underlying mechanisms. Moreover, colony formation assays were used to explore the effects of JQ1 on esophageal cancer Eca109 and breast cancer MCF7. JQ1 attenuated radiologic and histologic presentations of radiation-induced fibrosis, inflammatory reaction and pulmonary structural changes and the increase of Hounsfield units (HU) density and hydroxyproline content after radiation. Additionally, JQ1 suppressed BRD4, c-MYC, Collagen I, TGF-\u03b2, p-NF-\u03baB p65, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 expressions after irradiation, repressed proliferation and transdifferentiation of lung fibroblasts, and impaired clonogenic survival of thoracic cancer cells.

Immunomodulatory agents that promote these effects function via a wide variety of mechanisms, including upregulation of antigen presentation pathways. Here, we show that major histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I) genes are methylated in human breast cancers, suppressing their expression. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with a next-generation hypomethylating agent, guadecitabine, upregulates MHC-I expression in response to interferon-\u03b3. In murine tumor models of breast cancer, guadecitabine upregulates MHC-I in tumor cells promoting recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the microenvironment. Finally, we show that MHC-I genes are upregulated in breast cancer patients treated with hypomethylating agents. Thus, the immunomodulatory effects of hypomethylating agents likely involve upregulation of class-I antigen presentation to potentiate CD8+ T cell responses.

{"title": "MRI features predictive of negative surgical margins in patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer undergoing breast conservation.", "abstract": "Here we develop a tool to predict resectability of HER2+ breast cancer at breast conservation surgery (BCS) utilizing features identified on preoperative breast MRI. We identified patients with HER2+ breast cancer who obtained pre-operative breast MRI and underwent BCS between 2002-2013. From the contoured tumor on pre-operative MRI, shape, histogram, and co-occurrence and size zone matrix texture features were extracted. In univariate analysis, Spearman's correlation coefficient (Rs) was used to assess the correlation between each image feature and an endpoint (surgical re-excision). For multivariate modeling, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) method in a manner of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Of 109 patients with HER2+breast cancer who underwent BCS, 39% underwent surgical re-excision. 62% had residual cancer at re-excision. In univariate analysis, solidity (Rs\u2009=\u2009-0.32, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and extent (Rs\u2009=\u2009-0.29, p\u2009=\u20090.019) were significantly associated with re-excision.

However, due to the pro-metastatic potential of radiation and the intrinsic radiation resistance of some tumors, many patients experience RT failure, which leads to cancer relapse and distant metastasis. This preclinical study evaluated the efficacy of the antagonist of the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4, AMD3100, as a radiosensitizer in TNBC models. The combined effect of ionizing radiation and AMD3100 was determined in\u00a0vitro by surviving fraction, cell cycle distribution, Bax and Bcl-2 expression, and apoptosis assays in a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231). For in\u00a0vivo studies, human xenograft athymic nude mice were used. Treatment of TNBC cells with AMD3100 significantly augmented cellular radiosensitivity. Radiosensitivity was enhanced specifically through increased Bax expression, reduced Bcl-2 expression, prolonged G2-M arrest, and increased apoptosis. Combined treatment with AMD3100 and irradiation also enhanced tumor growth delay, with an enhancement factor ranging from 1.5 to 1.8.

{"title": "Leveraging ectopic Hsp90 expression to assay the presence of tumor cells and aggressive tumor phenotypes in breast specimens.", "abstract": "Hsp90 has been studied extensively as a therapeutic target in breast cancer in pre-clinical and clinical trials, demonstrating a variety of roles in metastatic progression. The evidence to date suggests a compelling opportunity to leverage attributes of Hsp90 expression beyond therapeutics with potential applications in breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and recurrence risk assessment. In this study, we developed a completely non-destructive strategy using HS-27, a fluorescently-tethered Hsp90 inhibitor, to assay Hsp90 expression on intact tissue specimens with comparable contrast to in vivo administration routes, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in breast cancer patients. In addition to Hsp90 inhibition being most effective in glycolytic tumors, we found ectopic Hsp90 expression to be highest in glycolytic tumors reinforcing its role as an indicator of aggressive disease.

{"title": "CBX4 exhibits oncogenic activities in breast cancer via Notch1 signaling.", "abstract": "Polycomb chromobox (CBX) proteins are involved in gene silencing to function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors through the polycomb repressive complex (PRC1). CBX4 has been implicated in the progression of human cancers, but its role and clinical significance in breast cancer remain unclear. Here, we show that CBX4 is up-regulated in breast cancer and exerts oncogenic activities via miR-137-mediated activation of Notch1 signaling pathway. CBX4 expression was increased in breast cancer, compared with the nontumorous tissues. High CBX4 expression was closely correlated with tumor metastasis, advanced clinical stage and poor overall survival in a cohort of 179 patients with breast cancer. In vitro studies demonstrated that CBX4 overexpression enhanced, whereas CBX4 knockdown inhibited cell growth and migration. Mechanistically, in a PRC1-dependent manner, CBX4 inhibited the promoter activity of miR-137 and suppressed its expression. miR-137 decreased the expression of Notch1, Jag1 and Hey2 via targeting their 3'-UTRs. The suppression of Notch1 by siRNA or overexpression of miR-137 markedly attenuated CBX4-promoted phenotypes. Collectively, these findings indicate that CBX4 promotes breast cancer via miR-137-mediated Notch1 signaling. Our data, therefore, suggest that CBX4 serve as a prognostic biomarker and that targeting CBX4/miR-137 axis may provide therapeutic potent in the treatment of breast cancer.", "journal": "The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology", "date": "2017-12-13", "authors": ["Jin-ShengZeng", "Zhen-DongZhang", "LiPei", "Zhi-ZhuBai", "YongYang", "HongYang", "Qiu-HongTian"], "doi": "10.1016/j.biocel.2017.12.006"}

These trials have been instrumental to establish standards for the treatment of early breast cancer.\nThe DBCG 82 trials had a global impact by documenting that the significant gain in loco-regional recurrence from postmastectomy radiation added to systemic therapy was associated with a reduction in distant recurrence and mortality in high-risk pre- and postmenopausal patients. The DBCG trials comparing breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy with mastectomy and more recently the trial of internal mammary node irradiation also had a major impact of practice. The trials initiated by the DBCG 40 years ago on tamoxifen and cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy became instrumental for the development of adjuvant systemic therapy not only due to their positive results but by sharing these important data with other members of the Early Breast Cancer Trialist' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG). Trials from the DBCG have also been important for highlighting the relative importance of anthracyclines and taxanes in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, DBCG has made a major contribution to the development of aromatase inhibitors and targeted adjuvant treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancers.\nThe substantial impact of these treatment improvements is illustrated by a 46.7% 10-year overall survival of early breast cancer patients treated in 1978-1987 compared to 71.5% for patients treated 2008-2012.\nThe trials conducted and implemented by the DBCG appear to have a major impact on the substantial survival improvements in breast cancer.", "journal": "Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)", "date": "2017-12-06", "authors": ["BentEjlertsen", "Birgitte VrouOffersen", "JensOvergaard", "PeerChristiansen", "Maj-BrittJensen", "NielsKroman", "Ann S\u00f8gaardKnoop", "HenningMouridsen"], "doi": "10.1080/0284186X.2017.1408962"}

{"title": "Knockdown of CAVEOLIN-1 Sensitizes Human Basal-Like Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells to Radiation.", "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a high-risk breast cancer phenotype without specific targeted therapy options and is significantly associated with increased local recurrence in patients treated with radiotherapy. CAVEOLIN-1 (CAV-1)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) nuclear translocation following irradiation promotes DNA repair and thus induces radiation resistance. In this study, we aimed to determine whether knockdown of CAV-1 enhances the radiosensitivity of basal-like TNBC cell lines and to explore the possible mechanisms.\nWestern blotting was used to compare protein expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Nuclear accumulation of EGFR as well as DNA repair and damage at multiple time points following irradiation with or without CAV-1 siRNA pretreatment were investigated using western blotting and confocal microscopy. The radiosensitizing effect of CAV-1 siRNA was evaluated using a clonogenic assay. Flowcytometry was performed to analyse cell apoptosis and cell cycle alteration.\nWe found that CAV-1 is over-expressed in basal-like TNBC cell lines and barely expressed in HER-2-positive cells; additionally, we observed that HER-2-positive cell lines are more sensitive to irradiation than basal-like TNBC cells. Our findings revealed that radiation-induced EGFR nuclear translocation was impaired by knockdown of CAV-1. In parallel, radiation-induced elevation of DNA repair proteins was also hampered by pretreatment with CAV-1 siRNA before irradiation. Silencing of CAV-1 also promoted DNA damage 24 h after irradiation. Colony formation assays verified that cells could be radiosensitized after knockdown of CAV-1. Furthermore, G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis enhancement may also contribute to the radiosensitizing effect of CAV-1 siRNA.\nOur results support the hypothesis that CAV-1 knockdown by siRNA causes increased radiosensitivity in basal-like TNBC cells. The mechanisms associated with this effect are reduced DNA repair through delayed CAV-1-associated EGFR nuclear accumulation and induction of G2/M arrest and apoptosis through the combined effects of CAV-1 siRNA and radiation.", "journal": "Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology", "date": "2017-11-24", "authors": ["ManZou", "YanhuiLi", "ShuXia", "QianChu", "XiaoguangXiao", "HongQiu", "YuChen", "Zu'anZheng", "FeiLiu", "LiangZhuang", "ShiyingYu"], "doi": "10.1159/000485291"}

{"title": "High-Risk Breast Lesions: A Machine Learning Model to Predict Pathologic Upgrade and Reduce Unnecessary Surgical Excision.", "abstract": "Purpose To develop a machine learning model that allows high-risk breast lesions (HRLs) diagnosed with image-guided needle biopsy that require surgical excision to be distinguished from HRLs that are at low risk for upgrade to cancer at surgery and thus could be surveilled. Materials and Methods Consecutive patients with biopsy-proven HRLs who underwent surgery or at least 2 years of imaging follow-up from June 2006 to April 2015 were identified. A random forest machine learning model was developed to identify HRLs at low risk for upgrade to cancer. Traditional features such as age and HRL histologic results were used in the model, as were text features from the biopsy pathologic report. Results One thousand six HRLs were identified, with a cancer upgrade rate of 11.4% (115 of 1006). A machine learning random forest model was developed with 671 HRLs and tested with an independent set of 335 HRLs. Among the most important traditional features were age and HRL histologic results (eg, atypical ductal hyperplasia). An important text feature from the pathologic reports was \"severely atypical.\" Instead of surgical excision of all HRLs, if those categorized with the model to be at low risk for upgrade were surveilled and the remainder were excised, then 97.4% (37 of 38) of malignancies would have been diagnosed at surgery, and 30.6% (91 of 297) of surgeries of benign lesions could have been avoided. Conclusion This study provides proof of concept that a machine learning model can be applied to predict the risk of upgrade of HRLs to cancer. Use of this model could decrease unnecessary surgery by nearly one-third and could help guide clinical decision making with regard to surveillance versus surgical excision of HRLs.

{"title": "TGF-\u03b21 secreted by Tregs in lymph nodes promotes breast cancer malignancy via up-regulation of IL-17RB.", "abstract": "Lymph node (LN) metastasis is commonly associated with systemic distant organ metastasis in human breast cancer and is an important prognostic predictor for survival of breast cancer patients. However, whether tumor-draining LNs (TDLNs) play a significant role in modulating the malignancy of cancer cells for distant metastasis remains controversial. Using a syngeneic mouse mammary tumor model, we found that breast tumor cells derived from TDLN have higher malignancy and removal of TDLNs significantly reduced distant metastasis. Up-regulation of oncogenic Il-17rb in cancer cells derived from TDLNs contributes to their malignancy. TGF-\u03b21 secreted from regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the TDLNs mediated the up-regulation of Il-17rb through downstream Smad2/3/4 signaling. These phenotypes can be abolished by TGF-\u03b21 neutralization or depletion of Tregs. Consistently, clinical data showed that the up-regulation of IL-17RB in cancer cells from LN metastases correlated with the increased prevalence of Tregs as well as the aggressive growth of tumors in mouse xenograft assay. Together, these results indicate that Tregs in TDLNs play an important role in modulating the malignancy of breast cancer cells for distant metastasis. Blocking IL-17RB expression could therefore be a potential approach to curb the process.", "journal": "EMBO molecular medicine", "date": "2017-10-11", "authors": ["Shih-ChiaHuang", "Pei-ChiWei", "Wendy WHwang-Verslues", "Wen-HungKuo", "Yung-MingJeng", "Chun-MeiHu", "Jin-YuhShew", "Chiun-ShengHuang", "King-JenChang", "Eva Y-HpLee", "Wen-HwaLee"], "doi": "10.15252/emmm.201606914"}
{"title": "New anti-HER2 agents: from second-generation tyrosine kinases inhibitors to bifunctional antibodies.", "abstract": "HER2-positive breast cancers have benefited since the end of the twentieth century, not only from the improvement of biological knowledge, but also from major technological advances. The latter allowed the synthesis of the first generation of enzymatic inhibitors of the HER receptor family such as lapatinib, but above all, monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab or pertuzumab having profoundly modified the management of these cancers. However, despite outstanding progresses, there are still patients who are not cured with these first-generation treatments, and they will need new approaches to improve disease control and impact patients' survival.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of escape to these treatments, more than real resistance, has profoundly changed our pharmacological approaches. They have enabled the development of molecules blocking the signaling pathway downstream of receptors such as mTOR, PI3K inhibitors or molecules interacting with the cellular traffic of the receptor in combination with the first-generation treatments. In addition, new second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated increased in-vitro efficacy, but still need to show clinical relevance because of new toxicity profiles. The antibody engineering had also permitted a paradigm evolution of the role of the antibody treatments, particularly with the synthesis of bispecific and trifunctional antibodies, promoting the link between the tumor and the immune system, with the goal to amplify the immune anticancer response.\nAmong the new anti-HER2 agents, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bifunctional antibodies are promising approaches that will help to improve disease control and curability of HER2-positive breast cancers.", "journal": "Current opinion in oncology", "date": "2017-10-07", "authors": ["JosephGligorov", "SandrineRichard", "VladimirTodorovic"], "doi": "10.1097/CCO.0000000000000412"}
{"title": "Nilotinib Enhances Tumor Angiogenesis and Counteracts VEGFR2 Blockade in an Orthotopic Breast Cancer Xenograft Model with Desmoplastic Response.", "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapies predominantly affect nascent, immature tumor vessels. Since platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) blockade inhibits vessel maturation and thus increases the amount of immature tumor vessels, we evaluated whether the combined PDGFR inhibition by nilotinib and VEGFR2 blockade by DC101 has synergistic therapy effects in a desmoplastic breast cancer xenograft model. In this context, besides immunohistological evaluation, molecular ultrasound imaging with BR55, the clinically used VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles, was applied to monitor VEGFR2-positive vessels noninvasively and to assess the therapy effects on tumor angiogenesis. DC101 treatment alone inhibited tumor angiogenesis, resulting in lower tumor growth and in significantly lower vessel density than in the control group after 14 days of therapy. In contrast, nilotinib inhibited vessel maturation but enhanced VEGFR2 expression, leading to markedly increased tumor volumes and a significantly higher vessel density. The combination of both drugs led to an almost similar tumor growth as in the DC101 treatment group, but VEGFR2 expression and microvessel density were higher and comparable to the controls. Further analyses revealed significantly higher levels of tumor cell-derived VEGF in nilotinib-treated tumors. In line with this, nilotinib, especially in low doses, induced an upregulation of VEGF and IL-6 mRNA in the tumor cells in vitro, thus providing an explanation for the enhanced angiogenesis observed in nilotinib-treated tumors in vivo. These findings suggest that nilotinib inhibits vessel maturation but counteracts the effects of antiangiogenic co-therapy by enhancing VEGF expression by the tumor cells and stimulating tumor angiogenesis.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2017-09-25", "authors": ["SaraZafarnia", "JessicaBzyl-Ibach", "IgorSpivak", "YongpingLi", "SusanneKoletnik", "DennisDoleschel", "AnneRix", "SibyllePochon", "IsabelleTardy", "SeenaKoyadan", "Marcvan Zandvoort", "MoritzPalmowski", "FabianKiessling", "WiltrudLederle"], "doi": "10.1016/j.neo.2017.08.009"}

Poor women were also less likely than near-poor or high SES women to receive any axillary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in use of aromatase inhibitors (AI) between poor and high SES women.

High DDX3 expression was present in 35% of breast cancer patient samples and correlated with markers of aggressiveness and shorter survival. With a quantitative proteomics approach, we identified proteins involved in the mitochondrial translation and respiratory electron transport pathways to be significantly downregulated after RK-33 or DDX3 knockdown. DDX3 localized to the mitochondria and DDX3 inhibition with RK-33 reduced mitochondrial translation. As a consequence, oxygen consumption rates and intracellular ATP concentrations decreased and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased. RK-33 antagonized the increase in oxygen consumption and ATP production observed after exposure to ionizing radiation and reduced DNA repair.

A pre-surgical window-of-opportunity study with irosustat was undertaken in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer to assess the effect of irosustat on tumour cell proliferation as measured by 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine uptake measured by PET scanning (FLT-PET) and Ki67.\nPostmenopausal women with untreated ER+ early breast cancer were recruited, and imaged with FLT-PET at baseline and after at least 2\u00a0weeks treatment with irosustat, 40\u00a0mg once daily orally. The primary endpoint was changed in FLT uptake; secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability of irosustat, changes in tumoral Ki67 and steroidogenic enzymes expression and circulating steroid hormone levels.\nThirteen women were recruited, and ten started irosustat for 2\u00a0weeks, followed by repeat FLT-PET scans in eight.

In one patient with a low baseline STS expression, a 19.7% increase in Ki67 was recorded. STS decreases were seen in tumours with high basal STS expression, significant decreases were also noted in aromatase, and 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and 2. Irosustat was generally well tolerated with all adverse event CTCAE Grade \u22642.\nIrosustat resulted in a significant reduction in FLT uptake and Ki67, and is well tolerated.

Anti-HER2 therapies administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy have been extensively studied, but only limited robust data are available concerning the safety and efficacy of anti-HER2 molecules in combination with radiotherapy.\nWe searched on Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases the articles providing data on the concomitant association between the antiHER2 therapies used in clinical practice (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib and T-DM1) with radiotherapy. The articles were selected according to their pre-clinical and clinical relevance.\nThe trastuzumab-irradiation combination is the most studied, with a focus on the cardiac toxicity. The combination of lapatinib-irradiation was particularly studied in the context of cerebral metastases of HER2-positive breast cancer. The data on pertuzumab and T-DM1 were poor and are mainly case reports.\nTo date, reliable conclusions about the toxicity and/or efficacy of concomitant irradiation with anti-HER2 therapies are difficult to make due to the heterogeneity of the data in the literature and need to be confirmed on a larger scale and long term follow-up.

{"title": "Impact of somatic PI3K pathway and ERBB family mutations on pathological complete response (pCR) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapies.", "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis revealed that somatic EGFR, receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ERBB2), Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) and Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4) gene mutations (ERBB family mutations) occur alone or co-occur with somatic mutations in the gene encoding the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) in 19% of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers. Because ERBB family mutations can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and likely have similar canonical signalling effects to PI3K pathway mutations, we investigated their combined impact on response to neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapies.\nBaseline tumour biopsies were available from 74 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who were enrolled in the phase II TCHL neoadjuvant study (ICORG 10-05) assessing TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) (n\u2009=\u200938) versus TCL (docetaxel, carboplatin, lapatinib) (n\u2009=\u200910) versus TCHL (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, lapatinib) (n\u2009=\u200940), each for six cycles. Activating mutations in PIK3CA and ERBB family genes were identified using mass spectrometry-based genotyping. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry.\nPIK3CA and/or ERBB family mutations were detected in 23 (31.1%) tumour samples tested, whereas PTEN expression was low in 31.1% of cases tested. Mutation frequency was similar in each treatment arm (31.3% in TCH arm, 30% in TCL arm and 31.3% in TCHL arm) and was not influenced by oestrogen receptor (ER) status (27.6% in ER-negative patients, 33.3% in ER-positive patients) or progesterone receptor (PR) status (32.6% in PR-negative patients, 29% in PR-positive patients). There was no significant difference in pathological complete response (pCR) rates between 47 patients with wild-type (WT) tumours and 22 patients whose tumours carried mutations (in either PIK3CA or ERBB family genes) (42.5% vs. 54.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.439). Similarly, there was no significant difference in pCR rates between patients with PIK3CA/ERBB family mutated/PTEN-low (i.e., PI3K-activated) tumours and patients without PI3K activation (50% vs. 44%; p\u2009=\u20090.769). However, in the TCHL (but not the TCH) group, the pCR rate was higher for 9 patients with PIK3CA/ERBB family mutated tumours than for 20 patients with PIK3CA/ERBB family WT tumours (77.8% vs. 35%; p\u2009=\u20090.05).\nOur results indicate that patients who receive neoadjuvant TCHL and have PIK3CA/ERBB family mutated tumours may be more likely to have a pCR than patients with WT tumours.\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01485926 .

Similarly, there exist scaling phenomena in medical images, and therefore a wide range of observation scales would be useful for medical imaging measurements.

We obtain the multiscale feature detectors by the sparse autoencoders with different receptive field sizes, and then generate the feature maps by the convolution operation. This strategy can better characterize various size structures in medical imaging than single-scale version. Subsequently, Fisher vector technique is used to encode the extracted features to implement a fixed-length image representation, which provides more abundant information of high-order statistics and enhances the descriptiveness and discriminative ability of feature representation.

HER2 has been linked to CSLCs in breast cancers and, therefore, we wanted to assess whether HER2 has a role in CSLCs in ALK translocated cancers. ALK translocated cell lines, H3122 and H2228, with variable sensitivity to ALK inhibition were used in the study. HER2 overexpression or knockdown was induced by retro- or lentiviral infections and cells were treated with pharmacological agents targeting HER2 and ALK signaling. Furthermore, tumorigenic properties of the cells were assessed in\u00a0vitro using colony and sphere formation assays. In the ALK inhibitor sensitive H3122 cells, HER2 overexpression unaltered the primary response to ALK inhibition, but increased CSLC marker expression and enhanced colony and sphere formation and late AKT and ERK1/2 signaling recovery. In the ALK inhibitor semi-sensitive H2228 cells, HER2 knockdown reduced basal expression of CSLC markers, modestly increased sensitivity to ALK inhibition in colony and sphere formation assays, and reduced late AKT and ERK1/2 signaling recovery. In addition, HER2 induced cross activation of other ErbB-members of which HER3 followed most closely the CSLC marker expression and neuregulin-1, a HER3 ligand, or pan-ErbB inhibitor afatinib, were able to alter CSLC marker expression and colony formation. the present study suggests that HER2 has an important role in the regulation of the CSLC phenotype in ALK translocated lung cancers that is mainly orchestrated by HER2/HER3 heterodimers.", "journal": "International journal of oncology", "date": "2017-06-29", "authors": ["TiiaHonkanen", "EmmiWilenius", "PeppiKoivunen", "Jussi PKoivunen"], "doi": "10.3892/ijo.2017.4048"}

Proliferation assay results showed that Noxin obviously promoted the ability of proliferation of normal breast cells. Subsequent western blot results revealed that Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 were upregulated by overexpressing Noxin, whereas Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 were downregulated after depleting Noxin. The levels of phosphorylated P38 and activating transcription factor 2 were obviously increased after overexpressing Noxin, and their expression was downregulated accordingly by transfecting Noxin-small interfering RNA. Moreover, P38 inhibitor counteracted the elevating expression of phosphorylated activating transcription factor 2, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E1 induced by Noxin overexpression and thereby reversed the effect of Noxin overexpression on facilitating cell growth. Taken together, our studies indicated that Noxin was overexpressed in breast cancer and its positive expression was significantly correlated with advance tumor-node-metastasis stage, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis.

B13 is an effective and selective acid ceramidase inhibitor in vitro, but not as effective in cells due to poor access to the lysosomal compartment. In order to achieve targeting of B13 to the lysosome, we designed lysosomotropic N, N-dimethyl glycine (DMG)-conjugated B13 prodrug LCL521 (1,3-di-DMG-B13). Our previous results indicated the efficient delivery of B13 to the lysosome resulted in augmented effects of LCL521 on cellular acid ceramidase as evaluated by effects on substrate/product levels.

Here we challenge this conclusion by showing that these studies failed to account for possible crosstalk between EMT and non-EMT cells that promotes dissemination of non-EMT cells. In breast cancer models, EMT cells induce increased metastasis of weakly metastatic, non-EMT tumour cells in a paracrine manner, in part by non-cell autonomous activation of the GLI transcription factor. Treatment with GANT61, a GLI1/2 inhibitor, but not with IPI 926, a Smoothened inhibitor, blocks this effect and inhibits growth in PDX models. In human breast tumours, the EMT-transcription factors strongly correlate with activated Hedgehog/GLI signalling but not with the Hh ligands. Our findings indicate that EMT contributes to metastasis via non-cell autonomous effects that activate the Hh pathway.

Recently, accumulating evidence has shown that cellular mechanical microenvironment also influences the cell volume. Herein, we investigated the regulation of substrate stiffness on the cell volume homeostasis of MCF-7 cells and their following migration behaviors. We found that cell volume increases with increasing substrate stiffness, which could be affected by blocking the cell membrane anion permeability and dopamine receptor. In addition, the cell migration is significantly inhibited by decreasing the cell volume using tamoxifen and such inhibition effect on migration is enhanced by increasing substrate stiffness. The cell membrane anion permeability might be the linker between cellular mechanical microenvironment and cellular volume homeostasis regulation.

However, no attempts have been made to extend the domain of KBP for planners with different planning experiences so far. The purpose of this study was to quantify the potential gains for planners with different planning experiences after implementing KBP in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for left-sided breast cancer patients.\nThe model libraries were populated with 80 expert clinical plans from treated patients who previously received left-sided breast-conserving surgery and IMRT with simultaneously integrated boost. The libraries were created on the RapidPlan\nAll plans were capable of achieving the prescription requirement. There were almost no statistically significant differences in terms of the planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose conformality. It was demonstrated that the doses for most of organs-at-risk (OARs) were on average lower or equal in KBP plans compared to manual plans except for the senior planners, where the very small differences were not statistically significant. KBP data showed a systematic trend to have superior dose sparing at most parameters for the heart and ipsilateral lung. The observed decrease in the doses to these OARs could be achieved, particularly for the beginner and junior planners. Many differences were statistically significant.\nIt is feasible to generate acceptable IMRT plans after implementing KBP for left-sided breast cancer. KBP helps to effectively improve the quality of IMRT plans against the benchmark of manual plans for less experienced planners without any manual intervention.

{"title": "An adaptive Fuzzy C-means method utilizing neighboring information for breast tumor segmentation in ultrasound images.", "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) imaging has been widely used in breast tumor diagnosis and treatment intervention. Automatic delineation of the tumor is a crucial first step, especially for the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and US-guided breast procedure. However, the intrinsic properties of US images such as low contrast and blurry boundaries pose challenges to the automatic segmentation of the breast tumor. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose a segmentation algorithm that can contour the breast tumor in US images.\nTo utilize the neighbor information of each pixel, a Hausdorff distance based fuzzy c-means (FCM) method was adopted. The size of the neighbor region was adaptively updated by comparing the mutual information between them. The objective function of the clustering process was updated by a combination of Euclid distance and the adaptively calculated Hausdorff distance. Segmentation results were evaluated by comparing with three experts' manual segmentations. The results were also compared with a kernel-induced distance based FCM with spatial constraints, the method without adaptive region selection, and conventional FCM.\nResults from segmenting 30 patient images showed the adaptive method had a value of sensitivity, specificity, Jaccard similarity, and Dice coefficient of 93.60 \u00b1 5.33%, 97.83 \u00b1 2.17%, 86.38 \u00b1 5.80%, and 92.58 \u00b1 3.68%, respectively.

All the metrics except sensitivity were better than that of the non-adaptive algorithm and the conventional FCM. Only three region-based metrics were better than that of the kernel-induced distance based FCM with spatial constraints.\nInclusion of the pixel neighbor information adaptively in segmenting US images improved the segmentation performance.

The liposomes were endowed with a combination of single chain antibody fragments specific for FAP and HER2 respectively, or with the FAP single chain antibody fragment in combination with Trastuzumab, which is specific for HER2. The Trastuzumab based bispecific formulation, termed Bi-FAP/Tras-IL revealed delivery of the encapsulated dye into the nuclei of HER2 expressing cancer cells and caused cell death at significantly higher rates than the free Trastuzumab. Furthermore, fluorescence imaging and live microscopy of tumor models in mice substantiated the delivery of the encapsulated cargo into the nuclei of target tumor cells and tumor stromal fibroblasts. Hence, they convey potentials to address tumor plasticity, to improve targeted cancer therapy and reduce Trastuzumab resistance in the future.\nThis work demonstrates the design of activatable bispecific liposomes aimed to target HER2, a poor prognosis tumor marker in many tumor types, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a universal tumor marker overexpressed on tumor fibroblasts and pericytes of almost all solid tumors. Encapsulating liposomes with a quenched concentration of a NIRF dye which only fluoresced after cellular degradation and activation enabled reliable visualization of the destination of the cargo in cells and animal studies. Conjugating single chain antibody fragments directed to FAP, together with Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody for HER2 resulted in the activatable bispecific liposomes. In animal models of xenografted human breast tumors, the remarkable ability of the bispecific probes to simultaneously deliver the encapsulated dye into the nuclei of target tumor cells and tumor fibroblasts could be demonstrated. Hence, the bispecific probes represent model tools with high significance to address tumor heterogeneity and manage Trastuzumab resistance in the future.", "journal": "Acta biomaterialia", "date": "2017-03-30", "authors": ["Felista LTansi", "RonnyR\u00fcger", "ClaudiaB\u00f6hm", "FrankSteiniger", "Roland EKontermann", "Ulf KTeichgraeber", "AlfredFahr", "IngridHilger"], "doi": "10.1016/j.actbio.2017.03.033"}

Recent work has suggested that the sigma-2 receptor may also be an effective therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a family of enzymes involved in DNA damage response. In this study, we looked for potential synergy of cytotoxicity between PARP inhibitors and sigma-2 receptor ligands in breast cancer cell lines. We showed that the PARP inhibitor, YUN3-6, sensitized mouse breast cancer cell line, EMT6, to sigma-2 receptor ligand (SV119, WC-26, and RHM-138) induced cell death determined by cell viability assay and colony forming assay. The PARP inhibitor, olaparib, sensitized tumor cells to a different sigma-2 receptor ligand SW43-induced apoptosis and cell death in human triple negative cell line, MDA-MB-231. Olaparib inhibited PARP activity and cell proliferation, and arrested cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle in MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells. Subsequently cells became sensitized to SW43 induced cell death. In conclusion, the combination of sigma-2 receptor ligands and PARP inhibitors appears to hold promise for synergistically triggering cell death in certain types of breast cancer cells and merits further investigation.", "journal": "Biochemical and biophysical research communications", "date": "2017-03-30", "authors": ["Elizabeth SMcDonald", "JuliaMankoff", "MehranMakvandi", "WenhuaChu", "YunxiangChu", "Robert HMach", "ChenboZeng"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.122"}

{"title": "Silencing BMI1 radiosensitizes human breast cancer cells by inducing DNA damage and autophagy.", "abstract": "Overexpression of BMI1 in human cancer cells, a member of the polycomb group of repressive complexes, correlates with advanced stage of disease, aggressive clinico-pathological behavior, poor prognosis, and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Studies have shown that experimental reduction of BMI1 protein level in tumor cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and/or senescence, and increased susceptibility to cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. Although a role for BMI1 in cancer progression and its importance as a molecular target for cancer therapy has been established, information on the impact of silencing BMI1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and its consequence on radiotherapy have not been well studied. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the potential therapeutic benefit of radiation therapy in BMI1-silenced breast cancer cells and studied the mechanism(s) of radiosensitization. Human MDA-MB-231 and SUM159PT breast cancer cells that were either stably transfected with a lentiviral vector expressing BMI1 shRNA (shBMI1) or control shRNA (shControl) or transient transfection with a BMI1-specific siRNA were used. Silencing of BMI1 resulted in marked reduction in BMI1 both at the mRNA and protein level that was accompanied by a significant reduction in cell migration compared to control cells. Further, BMI1 knockdown produced a marked enhancement of DNA damage as evidenced by Comet Assay and \u03b3H2AX foci, resulting in a dose-dependent radiosensitization effect. Molecular studies revealed modulation of protein expression that is associated with the DNA damage response (DDR) and autophagy pathways. Our results demonstrate that BMI1 is an important therapeutic target in breast cancer and suppression of BMI1 produces radiation sensitivity.

These phenomena confer resistance during current therapies, thus creating a major hurdle in radiotherapy/chemotherapy. The role of very low doses of radiation (LDR) in the context of EMT has not yet to be thoroughly explored.

{"title": "MR-based synthetic CT generation using a deep convolutional neural network method.", "abstract": "Interests have been rapidly growing in the field of radiotherapy to replace CT with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), due to superior soft tissue contrast offered by MRI and the desire to reduce unnecessary radiation dose. MR-only radiotherapy also simplifies clinical workflow and avoids uncertainties in aligning MR with CT. Methods, however, are needed to derive CT-equivalent representations, often known as synthetic CT (sCT), from patient MR images for dose calculation and DRR-based patient positioning. Synthetic CT estimation is also important for PET attenuation correction in hybrid PET-MR systems. We propose in this work a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) method for sCT generation and evaluate its performance on a set of brain tumor patient images.\nThe proposed method builds upon recent developments of deep learning and convolutional neural networks in the computer vision literature. The proposed DCNN model has 27 convolutional layers interleaved with pooling and unpooling layers and 35 million free parameters, which can be trained to learn a direct end-to-end mapping from MR images to their corresponding CTs. Training such a large model on our limited data is made possible through the principle of transfer learning and by initializing model weights from a pretrained model. Eighteen brain tumor patients with both CT and T1-weighted MR images are used as experimental data and a sixfold cross-validation study is performed. Each sCT generated is compared against the real CT image of the same patient on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Comparison is also made with respect to an atlas-based approach that involves deformable atlas registration and patch-based atlas fusion.\nThe proposed DCNN method produced a mean absolute error (MAE) below 85 HU for 13 of the 18 test subjects. The overall average MAE was 84.8 \u00b1 17.3 HU for all subjects, which was found to be significantly better than the average MAE of 94.5 \u00b1 17.8 HU for the atlas-based method. The DCNN method also provided significantly better accuracy when being evaluated using two other metrics: the mean squared error (188.6 \u00b1 33.7 versus 198.3 \u00b1 33.0) and the Pearson correlation coefficient(0.906 \u00b1 0.03 versus 0.896 \u00b1 0.03). Although training a DCNN model can be slow, training only need be done once. Applying a trained model to generate a complete sCT volume for each new patient MR image only took 9 s, which was much faster than the atlas-based approach.\nA DCNN model method was developed, and shown to be able to produce highly accurate sCT estimations from conventional, single-sequence MR images in near real time. Quantitative results also showed that the proposed method competed favorably with an atlas-based method, in terms of both accuracy and computation speed at test time. Further validation on dose computation accuracy and on a larger patient cohort is warranted. Extensions of the method are also possible to further improve accuracy or to handle multi-sequence MR images.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2017-02-14", "authors": ["XiaoHan"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.12155"}
{"title": "Overall survival and the response to radiotherapy among molecular subtypes of breast cancer brain metastases treated with targeted therapies.", "abstract": "The current study was conducted to investigate survival and the response to radiotherapy among patients with molecular subtypes of breast cancer brain metastases treated with or without targeted therapies.\nPatients diagnosed with breast cancer brain metastases at a single tertiary care institution were included. The primary outcome was overall survival, whereas secondary outcomes included the cumulative incidences of distant intracranial failure, local failure, and radiation necrosis. Competing risks regression was used to model secondary outcomes.\nWithin the study period, 547 patients presented with 3224 brain metastases and met inclusion criteria. Among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified disease, 80% received HER2 antibodies and 38% received HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The median survival was significantly shorter in the basal cohort (8.4 months), and progressively increased in the luminal A (12.3 months), HER2-positive (15.4 months), and luminal B (18.8 months) cohorts (P<.001). Among patients with HER2-amplified disease, the median survival was extended with the use of both HER2 antibodies (17.9 months vs 15.1 months; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and TKIs (21.1 months vs 15.4 months; P\u2009=\u2009.03). The 12-month cumulative incidences of local failure among molecular subtypes were 6.0% in the luminal A cohort, 10.3% in the luminal B cohort, 15.4% in the HER2-positive cohort, and 9.9% in the basal cohort (P\u2009=\u2009.01). Concurrent HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor TKIs with stereotactic radiosurgery significantly decreased the 12-month cumulative incidence of local failure from 15.1% to 5.7% (P<.001).\nMolecular subtypes appear to be prognostic for survival and predictive of the response to radiotherapy. TKIs were found to improve survival and local control, and may decrease the rate of distant failure.

{"title": "Combination treatment using DDX3 and PARP inhibitors induces synthetic lethality in BRCA1-proficient breast cancer.", "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancers have unfavorable outcomes due to their inherent aggressive behavior and lack of targeted therapies. Breast cancers occurring in BRCA1 mutation carriers are mostly triple-negative and harbor homologous recombination deficiency, sensitizing them to inhibition of a second DNA damage repair pathway by, e.g., PARP inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance against PARP inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient cancers is common and sensitivity is limited in BRCA1-proficient breast cancers. RK-33, an inhibitor of the RNA helicase DDX3, was previously demonstrated to impede non-homologous end-joining repair of DNA breaks. Consequently, we evaluated DDX3 as a therapeutic target in BRCA pro- and deficient breast cancers and assessed whether DDX3 inhibition could sensitize cells to PARP inhibition. High DDX3 expression was identified by immunohistochemistry in breast cancer samples of 24% of BRCA1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.337) and 21% of BRCA2 mutation carriers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.624), as compared to 30% of sporadic breast cancer samples. The sensitivity to the DDX3 inhibitor RK-33 was similar in BRCA1 pro- and deficient breast cancer cell lines, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range (2.8-6.6\u00a0\u03bcM).

{"title": "Animal Models of Secondary Lymphedema: New Approaches in the Search for Therapeutic Options.", "abstract": "Secondary lymphedema is still a worldwide problem. Symptomatic approaches to lymphedema therapy have been mainly used, with complete decongestive therapy as the cornerstone. Due to a lack of regenerative therapy, researchers have established various animal models to obtain insights into pathomechanisms and to reveal the best therapeutic option. Since the first reproducible and reliable animal model of lymphedema was reported in dogs, the technique of circumferential excision of lymphatic tissue has been translated mainly to rodents to induce secondary lymphedema. In these models, various promising pharmacological and surgical approaches have been investigated to improve secondary lymphedema therapy. Imaging modalities are crucial to detect the extent of lymphatic dysfunction and decide the best therapy. The gold standard of lymphoscintigraphy is currently limited by poor spatial resolution and lack of quantification. Animal models could help to bridge a gap in improving morphological correlation and quantifying lymphatic functionality. This review summarizes the animal models used in lymphatic research and focuses on new therapeutic options and requirements for imaging modalities to visualize the lymphatic system.", "journal": "Lymphatic research and biology", "date": "2017-01-28", "authors": ["RebeccaHadrian", "DanielPalmes"], "doi": "10.1089/lrb.2016.0015"}

Patients treated with breast-conserving surgery received a boost dose to the tumor bed (delivered by photons, electrons, or interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy). Two hundred fifty-six (99.6%) patients underwent chemotherapy, 209 (81.3%) had hormonal treatment, and 65 (25.3%) had anti-HER2 targeted therapy.\nThe median follow-up time was 64\u00a0months (range, 11-88\u00a0months). The rates of 5-year OS, DFS, locoregional recurrence (LRR)-free survival, and distant metastasis (DM)-free survival were 86.6%, 84.4%, 93.9%, and 83.1%, respectively. In multivariate analysis (MVA), lymph node ratio >65%, lymphovascular invasion, and negative hormone receptor status predicted for OS, DSF, and DM. T3 to 4 stage was also associated with worse DFS and DM. Finally, for LRR the independent prognostic factors on MVA were N2 to 3 stage and grade 3.

Some of these effects such as those presented by anthracyclines, radiation therapy, cisplatin, as well as those presented by hormone therapy for breast cancer-usually taken for many years for some breast and prostate cancers-are long-lasting and associated with cardiovascular events risk more than 20\u2005years after cancer treatment. Cardiovascular testing, diagnostic assessment of suspected cardiovascular symptomatology, as well as laboratory tests for CVD risk factors are imperative. The early recognition and treatment of CVD processes that arise in survivorship years is pivotal, with specific attention to some CVD processes with specific suggested treatment modalities. Preventive measures include adequate screening, the use of medications such as ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or beta blockers, statin therapy and aspirin in persons who warrant these medications, as well as therapeutic lifestyle modifications such as exercise/physical activity, weight loss and appropriate diet for a healthy lifestyle. Periodic follow-up with a good primary care physician who understands the risks associated with cancer therapy is important, and referral to onco-cardiology for further management of cardiovascular risk in these survivors is based on a patient's cardiovascular risk level and the type, amount and duration of cancer therapies received during the patient's lifetime.", "journal": "Postgraduate medical journal", "date": "2017-01-27", "authors": ["Tochi MOkwuosa", "SarahAnzevino", "RutaRao"], "doi": "10.1136/postgradmedj-2016-134417"}
{"title": "Ganetespib overcomes resistance to PARP inhibitors in breast cancer by targeting core proteins in the DNA repair machinery.", "abstract": "DNA damage repair plays essential roles in drug resistance, especially resistance to Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the clinic. A subset of DNA repair proteins such as Breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1), BRCA2 and RecA homolog (RAD51) are client proteins of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Clearance of these DNA repair proteins by inhibition of Hsp90 is a promising strategy for overcoming resistance to PARP inhibitors. Here we report the pharmacological analysis of the highly potent second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor, ganetespib. Methods Nuclear BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 expression in breast cancer cells were detected by subcellular fractionation and western blot analysis. Formation of nuclear RAD51 and \u03b3-H2AX foci was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining. The cytotoxicity of ganetespib and ABT-888 in breast cancer cells were evaluated by cell proliferation, colony survival, and apoptosis assay. To investigate the efficacy of this therapy in vivo, SCID mice bearing MCF7 xenografts were treated with ganetespib and ABT-888, both as single agents and in combination. Results Ganetespib significantly destabilized nuclear BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, and efficiently disrupted homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break repair in breast cancer cells. The synergistic antitumor effects of ganetespib and the PARP inhibitor, ABT-888 were observed, and concurrent treatment with both inhibitors synergistically inhibited xenograft tumor growth. Importantly, the combined treatment was well tolerated, without significant loss of body weight or major histological changes in the breast cancer xenograft model.

Blood samples were collected to measure serum hormone and calcium levels.\nWe consecutively included 263 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early BC. One-hundred-sixty-nine women were AI-na\u00efve, and 94 were AI-treated. AI-treated patients had lower BMD at total hip (p=0.01) and lumbar spine (p=0.03), higher serum vitamin D (p<0.001) and parathyroid hormone (p=0.006) values as compared to AI-na\u00efve patients. The prevalence of VFs was 18.9% in AI-na\u00efve patients, and 31.2% in those assessed during AI therapy (odds ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.1-3.5, p=0.03). In AI-na\u00efve patients, VFs were associated with older age (p=0.002) and lower BMD values at femoral neck (p=0.04) and total hip (p=0.007), whereas VFs occurred without association with any parameter analyzed in AI-treated patients. In AI-treated group, the prevalence of VFs was not significantly different between patients with osteoporosis and those with normal BMD (36.7% vs. 20.0%; p=0.31).\nIn women with early BC, AI therapy is associated with high prevalence of radiological VFs, which were shown to be independent of BMD values during the adjuvant treatment.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the long-term skeletal effects of AIs in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer.\nWe performed a retrospective longitudinal observational study in non-osteoporotic patients with breast cancer who were treated with AIs for \u22653\u00a0years (T-score >-2.5).

Lumbar spine TBS also significantly decreased from baseline to 5\u00a0years (-2.12%); this change remained significant after adjusting for lumbar spine BMD. The annual loss of lumbar spine BMD and TBS slowed after 3 and 1\u00a0year of treatment, respectively, although there was a relatively constant loss of BMD at the femur neck and total hip for up to 4\u00a0years. The cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia, minimal neck width, femur strength index, and section modulus significantly decreased, although the buckling ratio increased over the treatment period (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001); these changes were independent of total hip BMD.\nLong-term adjuvant AI treatment negatively influenced bone quality in addition to BMD in patients with breast cancer.

{"title": "Multi-modality imaging to assess metabolic response to dichloroacetate treatment in tumor models.", "abstract": "Reverting glycolytic metabolism is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy as upregulated glycolysis is a hallmark in various cancers. Dichloroacetate (DCA), long used to treat lactic acidosis in various pathologies, has emerged as a promising anti-cancer drug. By inhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, DCA reactivates the mitochondrial function and decreases the glycolytic flux in tumor cells resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We recently documented that DCA was able to induce a metabolic switch preferentially in glycolytic cancer cells, leading to a more oxidative phenotype and decreasing proliferation, while oxidative cells remained less sensitive to DCA treatment. To evaluate the relevance of this observation in vivo, the aim of the present study was to characterize the effect of DCA in glycolytic MDA-MB-231 tumors and in oxidative SiHa tumors using advanced pharmacodynamic metabolic biomarkers. Oxygen consumption, studied by 17O magnetic resonance spectroscopy, glucose uptake, evaluated by 18F-FDG PET and pyruvate transformation into lactate, measured using hyperpolarized 13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, were monitored before and 24 hours after DCA treatment in tumor bearing mice. In both tumor models, no clear metabolic shift was observed. Surprisingly, all these imaging parameters concur to the conclusion that both glycolytic tumors and oxidative tumors presented a similar response to DCA.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are adaptive algorithms capable of performing pattern-to-pattern learning and are well suited for medical applications. They are potentially useful for calibrating full-field digital mammography (FFDM) for quantitative analysis. This study uses ANN modeling to estimate volumetric breast density (VBD) from FFDM on Japanese women with and without breast cancer.

{"title": "Systemic therapy for HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer.", "abstract": "The advent of the targeted monoclonal antbody trastuzumab for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer marked a revolution in the understanding and management of mammary carcinoma and, in practice, separated this subtype from other kinds of primary breast malignancy. Long term follow-up from the initial large adjuvant trials continue to show remarkably positive results. Currently, at least four additional agents targeting this receptor, using different and complementary mechanisms of action compared with trastuzumab, have been incorporated into clinical trials. The small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors lapatinib and neratinib, in addition to the antibody pertuzumab and the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-ematansine, have shown efficacy in metastatic breast cancer and are being evaluated both in neoadjuvant and adjuvant trials for early stage disease. The cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens used in combination with these agents also are evolving and different therapeutic approaches are emerging for patients depending on their relative level of risk from their cancers, thus moving clinical management toward individualized therapy. Much has been learned about managing the toxicities of treatment and pre-operative approaches have provided a means of assessing the sensitivity of individual patients' cancers to specific treatment regimens. This review traces the development of these studies and focuses on improvements in adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive disease whose prognosis has changed in the last decade from dire to favorable.

HER2 breast cancers are aggressive and are associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to develop the clinical grade Lu-177-trastuzumab and its preliminary evaluation for specific tumor targeting in HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Trastuzumab was conjugated to bifunctional chelator, DOTA, and characterized for integrity and the number of molecules conjugated. Radiolabeling of DOTA-conjugated trastuzumab was optimized using Lu-177. Quality control parameters including radiochemical purity, stability, sterility, pyrogenicity and immunoreactivity were assessed. A preliminary pilot study was conducted on breast cancer patients (n\u2009=\u20096 HER2 positive and n\u2009=\u20094 HER2 negative) to evaluate the ability of Lu-177-trastuzumab for HER2 specific tumor targeting. The conjugates were efficiently labeled with Lu-177 with high radiochemical purity (up to 91%) and specific activity (6-13 \u00b5Ci/\u00b5g). Lu-177-trastuzumab was stable up to 12 hr post labeling. The radioimmunoassay demonstrated good antigen binding ability and specificity for HER2 receptor protein. The patient studies showed the localization of Lu-177-trastuzumab at primary as well as metastatic sites (HER2 positive) in the planar and SPECT/CT images. No tracer uptake was observed in HER2 negative patients that indicated the specificity of Lu-177-trastuzumab.

{"title": "Therapeutic Potential, Challenges and Future Perspective of Cancer Stem Cells in Translational Oncology: A Critical Review.", "abstract": "Stem cell research is a rapidly developing field that offers effective treatment for a variety of malignant and non-malignant diseases. Stem cell is a regenerative medicine associated with the replacement, repair, and restoration of injured tissue. Stem cell research is a promising field having maximum therapeutic potential. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cells within the tumor that posses capacity of selfrenewal and have a root cause for the failure of traditional therapies leading to re-occurrence of cancer. CSCs have been identified in blood, breast, brain, and colon cancer. Traditional therapies target only fast growing tumor mass, but not slow-dividing cancer stem cells. It has been shown that embryonic pathways such as Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch, control self-renewal capacity and involved in cancer stem cell maintenance. Targeting of these pathways may be effective in eradicating cancer stem cells and preventing chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance. Targeting CSCs has become one of the most effective approaches to improve the cancer survival by eradicating the main root cause of cancer.

Simeprevir was selected, and its inhibition of PI4K III\u03b1 activity was confirmed. Combination of simeprevir treatment and radiation significantly attenuated expression of phospho-phospho-PKC and phospho-Akt and increased radiation-induced cell death in tested cell lines. Pretreatment with simeprevir prolonged \u03b3H2AX foci formation and down-regulation of phospho-DNA-PKcs, indicating impairment of nonhomologous end-joining repair.

By increasing the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation and decreasing the marginal dose, it is possible to improve therapeutic efficacy and decrease side-effects. In radiation-induced cells, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling mediates the phosphorylation of H2AX, which indicates DNA damage sensitivity and modulates the effect of radiation. Lewis lung cancer (LLC) and breast cancer (4T1) cells were irradiated with a Gamma Knife in cell culture tubes. To evaluate the relationship between radiosensitivity and JNK activity, clonogenic assay was performed. DNA damage response was estimated by \u03b3H2AX focus formation assay and apoptosis\u2011related protein levels were assessed by western blotting. The mice were subcutaneously inoculated with LLC cells, and irradiated concomitantly with JNK inhibitor treatment. The effect of the JNK inhibitor was investigated by tumor volumetry and immunohistochemistry. \u03b3H2AX expression, which mediates repair of radiation\u2011induced DNA damage, was reduced in the cancer cell group pretreated with the JNK inhibitor. This finding shows that JNK inhibition may increase the radiosensitivity in radiated lung and breast cancer cells.

{"title": "Strong synergism between small molecule inhibitors of HER2, PI3K, mTOR and Bcl-2 in human breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Targeting pro-survival cell signaling components has been promising in cancer therapy, but the benefit of targeting with single agents is limited. For malignancies such as triple-negative breast cancer, there is a paucity of targets that are amenable to existing interventions as they are devoid of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), progesterone receptor (PR), and estrogen receptor (ER). Concurrent targeting of cell signaling entities other than HER2, PR and ER with multiple agents may be more effective. Evaluating modes of interaction between agents can inform efficient selection of agents when used in cocktails. Using clonogenic cell survival, interaction between inhibitors of HER2 (TAK-165), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (NVP-BEZ235), and the pro-survival gene (Bcl-2) (ABT-263) in three human breast cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and MCF-12A) ranged from strong to very strong synergism. The strongest synergy was demonstrated in PR and ER negative cells. Inhibition of PI3K, mTOR and Bcl-2 could potentially be effective in the treatment of triple-negative cancers. The very strong synergy observed even at lowest concentrations of inhibitors indicates that these cocktails might be able to be used at a minimised risk of systemic toxicity.

{"title": "The epichaperome is an integrated chaperome network that facilitates tumour survival.", "abstract": "Transient, multi-protein complexes are important facilitators of cellular functions. This includes the chaperome, an abundant protein family comprising chaperones, co-chaperones, adaptors, and folding enzymes-dynamic complexes of which regulate cellular homeostasis together with the protein degradation machinery. Numerous studies have addressed the role of chaperome members in isolation, yet little is known about their relationships regarding how they interact and function together in malignancy. As function is probably highly dependent on endogenous conditions found in native tumours, chaperomes have resisted investigation, mainly due to the limitations of methods needed to disrupt or engineer the cellular environment to facilitate analysis. Such limitations have led to a bottleneck in our understanding of chaperome-related disease biology and in the development of chaperome-targeted cancer treatment. Here we examined the chaperome complexes in a large set of tumour specimens. The methods used maintained the endogenous native state of tumours and we exploited this to investigate the molecular characteristics and composition of the chaperome in cancer, the molecular factors that drive chaperome networks to crosstalk in tumours, the distinguishing factors of the chaperome in tumours sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition, and the characteristics of tumours that may benefit from chaperome therapy. We find that under conditions of stress, such as malignant transformation fuelled by MYC, the chaperome becomes biochemically 'rewired' to form a network of stable, survival-facilitating, high-molecular-weight complexes. The chaperones heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) are nucleating sites for these physically and functionally integrated complexes. The results indicate that these tightly integrated chaperome units, here termed the epichaperome, can function as a network to enhance cellular survival, irrespective of tissue of origin or genetic background. The epichaperome, present in over half of all cancers tested, has implications for diagnostics and also provides potential vulnerability as a target for drug intervention.", "journal": "Nature", "date": "2016-10-21", "authors": ["AnnaRodina", "TaiWang", "PengrongYan", "Erica DaGamaGomes", "Mark P SDunphy", "NagavarakishorePillarsetty", "JohnKoren", "John FGerecitano", "TonyTaldone", "HongliangZong", "EloisiCaldas-Lopes", "MaryAlpaugh", "AdrianaCorben", "MatthewRiolo", "BradBeattie", "ChristinaPressl", "Radu IPeter", "ChaoXu", "RobertTrondl", "Hardik JPatel", "FumikoShimizu", "AlexanderBolaender", "ChenghuaYang", "PalakPanchal", "Mohammad FFarooq", "SarahKishinevsky", "ShanuModi", "OscarLin", "FeixiaChu", "SujataPatil", "HediyeErdjument-Bromage", "PatZanzonico", "CliffordHudis", "LorenzStuder", "Gail JRoboz", "EthelCesarman", "LeandroCerchietti", "RossLevine", "AriMelnick", "Steven MLarson", "Jason SLewis", "Monica LGuzman", "GabrielaChiosis"], "doi": "10.1038/nature19807"}

Materials and Methods Identified were 132 patients with primary triple-negative breast cancers who underwent NAC and pretreatment MR imaging between 2004 and 2010. Three breast radiologists independently reviewed the MR images based on the 2013 Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. Presence of intratumoral high signal intensity and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted images was also evaluated. Association of PCR and recurrence-free survival with MR imaging features was assessed by using logistic regression and Cox regression. Bonferroni correction was applied to the P values.

Round or oval masses (odds ratio, 3.5 [95% confidence interval: 1.3, 9.7]; P = .02), the absence of intratumoral T2 high signal intensity (odds ratio, 3.8 [95% confidence interval: 1.3, 11.0]; P = .01), and the absence of peritumoral edema (odds ratio, 3.4 [95% confidence interval: 1.2, 9.5]; P = .02) were associated with PCR, but not significantly. After 54 months of median follow-up, there were 41 (31% [41 of 132]) breast cancer recurrences.

This paper presents a text mining system for detecting admissions marked as positive for several diseases: Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer, Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Respiratory and Digestive Organs, Multiple Myeloma and Malignant Plasma Cell Neoplasms, Pneumonia, and Pulmonary Embolism. We specifically examine the effect of linking multiple data sources on text classification performance.\nSupport Vector Machine classifiers are built for eight data source combinations, and evaluated using the metrics of Precision, Recall and F-Score. Sub-sampling techniques are used to address unbalanced datasets of medical records. We use radiology reports as an initial data source and add other sources, such as pathology reports and patient and hospital admission data, in order to assess the research question regarding the impact of the value of multiple data sources. Statistical significance is measured using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A second set of experiments explores aspects of the system in greater depth, focusing on Lung Cancer. We explore the impact of feature selection; analyse the learning curve; examine the effect of restricting admissions to only those containing reports from all data sources; and examine the impact of reducing the sub-sampling. These experiments provide better understanding of how to best apply text classification in the context of imbalanced data of variable completeness.\nRadiology questions plus patient and hospital admission data contribute valuable information for detecting most of the diseases, significantly improving performance when added to radiology reports alone or to the combination of radiology and pathology reports.\nOverall, linking data sources significantly improved classification performance for all the diseases examined.

Randomized trials have found that therapy including tamoxifen citrate and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) reduces CBC risk. But little is known about the magnitude and duration of protective associations within the context of real-world clinical management settings, where varying durations of and gaps in treatment are common.\nTo determine the association between adjuvant tamoxifen and AI therapy and CBC risk within a general community setting.\nA retrospective cohort study of CBC risk among 7541 patients diagnosed with a first primary unilateral invasive breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente Institute for Health Research (Colorado) or Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research (Oregon) between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2008. Data were analyzed from 1 year after diagnosis of the first breast cancer through the earliest of the following events: CBC diagnosis, other second cancer diagnosis, death, last tumor registry follow-up, exit from the Kaiser Permanente health care plan, or end of study follow-up (December 31, 2010, for Oregon and December 31, 2011, for Colorado).\nAdjuvant tamoxifen use and AI therapy were treated as time-dependent exposures, assessed using electronic prescription records.\nIncident CBC based on long-term systematic follow-up.\nAmong 7541 women with invasive breast cancer, median age at initial breast cancer diagnosis was 60.6 years (age range, 24.9-84.9 years). Women were predominantly (92.9% [7009 of 7541]) of white race. During a median of 6.3 years (range, 1-20.9 years) of follow-up, 248 women developed CBC (45 in situ and 203 invasive). Contralateral breast cancer risk decreased significantly with increasing tamoxifen therapy duration. In current users, the relative risk (RR) per year of tamoxifen use was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64-0.89), with an estimated 66% (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.29-0.40) RR reduction for 4 years of use compared with nonusers. Risk reductions were slightly smaller for past users but were still significant at least 5 years after stopping tamoxifen therapy (RR per year of use, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-0.995). In addition, AI use without tamoxifen therapy was associated with reduced CBC risk (RR for AI users compared with nonusers, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.22-0.97). Risk reductions were most apparent among women whose primary and CBCs were estrogen receptor positive.\nTamoxifen therapy was associated with reduced CBC risk during treatment and after its cessation, with risk progressively decreasing as tamoxifen therapy duration increased. Among those surviving at least 5 years, tamoxifen use for at least 4 years was estimated to prevent 3 CBCs per 100 women by 10 years after an estrogen receptor-positive first breast cancer, an absolute risk reduction that is consistent with findings from clinical trials.

The mechanistic role of upstream mediators of EMT has not yet been well characterized. Recently, we showed that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that have undergone EMT overexpress AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase. AXL is also overexpressed in a subset of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), and its overexpression has been associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and linked to resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. Because the DNA repair pathway is also altered in patient tumor specimens overexpressing AXL, it is hypothesized that modulation of AXL in cells that have undergone EMT will sensitize them to agents targeting the DNA repair pathway. Downregulation or inhibition of AXL directly reversed the EMT phenotype, led to decreased expression of DNA repair genes, and diminished efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) and RAD51 foci formation. As a result, AXL inhibition caused a state of HR deficiency in the cells, making them sensitive to inhibition of the DNA repair protein, PARP1. AXL inhibition synergized with PARP inhibition, leading to apoptotic cell death. AXL expression also associated positively with markers of DNA repair across TNBC, HNSCC, and NSCLC patient cohorts.\nThe novel role for AXL in DNA repair, linking it to EMT, suggests that AXL can be an effective therapeutic target in combination with targeted therapy such as PARP inhibitors in several different malignancies.

{"title": "Targeting DNA double strand break repair with hyperthermia and DNA-PKcs inhibition to enhance the effect of radiation treatment.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy is based on the induction of lethal DNA damage, primarily DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Efficient DSB repair via Non-Homologous End Joining or Homologous Recombination can therefore undermine the efficacy of radiotherapy. By suppressing DNA-DSB repair with hyperthermia (HT) and DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441 (DNA-PKcsi), we aim to enhance the effect of radiation.The sensitizing effect of HT for 1 hour at 42\u00b0C and DNA-PKcsi [1 \u03bcM] to radiation treatment was investigated in cervical and breast cancer cells, primary breast cancer sphere cells (BCSCs) enriched for cancer stem cells, and in an in vivo human tumor model. A significant radio-enhancement effect was observed for all cell types when DNA-PKcsi and HT were applied separately, and when both were combined, HT and DNA-PKcsi enhanced radio-sensitivity to an even greater extent. Strikingly, combined treatment resulted in significantly lower survival rates, 2 to 2.5 fold increase in apoptosis, more residual DNA-DSB 6 h post treatment and a G2-phase arrest. In addition, tumor growth analysis in vivo showed significant reduction in tumor growth and elevated caspase-3 activity when radiation was combined with HT and DNA-PKcsi compared to radiation alone. Importantly, no toxic side effects of HT or DNA-PKcsi were found.In conclusion, inhibiting DNA-DSB repair using HT and DNA-PKcsi before radiotherapy leads to enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells. This effect was even noticed in the more radio-resistant BCSCs, which are clearly sensitized by combined treatment. Therefore, the addition of HT and DNA-PKcsi to conventional radiotherapy is promising and might contribute to more efficient tumor control and patient outcome.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-09-08", "authors": ["Bregjevan Oorschot", "GiovannaGranata", "SimoneDi Franco", "RosemarieTen Cate", "Hans MRodermond", "MatildeTodaro", "Jan PaulMedema", "Nicolaas A PFranken"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.11798\n10.18632/oncotarget.11022"}

Thus we studied MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines treated with epirubicin (EPI) to assess autophagy and apoptosis. We found out that EPI induced apoptosis and autophagy in both cell lines. The lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 inhibited cellular autophagy and enhanced EPI-triggered apoptosis, perhaps due to inhibition of autolysosome formation, which then inhibited autophagic effects of engulfing and clearing damaged mitochondria. This inhibition increased mitochondrial cytochrome C release which augmented epirubicin-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and cytotoxicity. In addition, the lysosomal neutralizing agent ammonia chloride (AC), and Atg7 knockdown by siRNA, could inhibit epirubicin-triggered autophagy, enhance cytotoxicity, and increase caspase-9- and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis.

The present study was designed to assess prospective changes in TBS and lumbar spine (LS) BMD in postmenopausal women with breast cancer at completion of AI treatment.\nB-ABLE is a prospective cohort of 735 women with breast cancer treated with AIs according to American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations: 5years of AI starting within 6weeks post-surgery or 1month after the last cycle of chemotherapy (5y-AI group), or switching to an AI to complete 5-year therapy after 2-3years of tamoxifen (pTMX-AI group).

This article contains information related to RIC, as well as potential strategies for the prevention and treatment of RIC. In addition, new findings are reported here on the occurrence of RIC biomarkers in humans exposed to radiation. To determine whether irradiated humans have RIC biomarkers, blood samples were obtained from radiotherapy patients who received treatment for different types of malignancies. Blood samples from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) patients obtained before, during and after irradiation indicated that exposure led to prolonged clot formation times, increased levels of thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complex and increased circulating nucleosome/histone (cNH) levels, which suggest potential coagulopathies in the allo-HCT patients. Since these allo-HCT patients received chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy, it is possible that the chemical agents could have influenced the observed results. Frozen plasma samples from radiotherapy patients with prostate, lung and breast cancer were also obtained for analyses of cNH levels. The results indicated that some of these patients had very high cNH blood levels. Analysis of cNH levels in plasma samples from irradiated ferrets also indicated increased cNH levels compared to preirradiation baseline levels. The results from irradiated animals and some radiotherapy patients suggest the possibility that anti-histone antibodies, which block the toxic effects of elevated cNH levels in the blood, might be useful as therapeutic agents for adverse biological radiation-induced effects. The detection of increased levels of cNH in some radiotherapy patient blood samples demonstrates its potential as a biomarker for diagnosing and/or predicting the propensity for developing coagulopathies/hemorrhage, offering possible treatment options with personalized medicine therapies for cancer patients.", "journal": "Radiation research", "date": "2016-07-28", "authors": ["Ann RKennedy", "AmitMaity", "Jenine KSanzari"], "doi": "10.1667/RR14406.1"}

Consequently, therapies that abrogate BTIC activity are needed to achieve durable cures for breast cancer patients. To identify such therapies we used a sensitive assay to complete a high-throughput screen of small molecules, including approved drugs, with BTIC-rich mouse mammary tumor cell populations. We found that inhibitors of the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and serotonin receptors, which include approved drugs used to treat mood disorders, were potent inhibitors of mouse BTIC activity as determined by functional sphere-forming assays and the initiation of tumor formation by transplant of drug-exposed tumor cells into syngeneic mice. Moreover, sertraline (Zoloft), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), synergized with docetaxel (Taxotere) to shrink mouse breast tumors in vivo.

{"title": "HER2 reduces breast cancer radiosensitivity by activating focal adhesion kinase in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "Growing evidence has demonstrated that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is involved in the radiation response to breast cancer. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated if HER2 overexpression is associated with radiosensitivity of breast cancer. We constructed breast cancer cell lines differing in HER2 expression by transducing HER2 cDNA or short hairpin RNA against HER2. We then assessed the radiosensitivity and investigated the potential mechanism by using cell proliferation assay, cell adhesion assays, anoikis assays, colony formation assays, and western blotting analyses. We found that HER2 introduction in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (low HER2 expression) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2 is not expressed) promoted cell proliferation and invasion and enhanced cell adhesion and resistance to anoikis. Moreover, HER2 reduced radiosensitivity in these two cells compared with the corresponding control. The opposite results were observed when HER2 was silenced in breast cancer cell lines ZR-7530 and SK-BR-3 (both cells with high expression of HER2) using HER2 shRNA. In addition, animal experiment results showed HER2 could enhance the radioresistance of xenograft tumors. Further studies showed HER2 promoted the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (Fak) and thereby up-regulated the expression of proteins associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition such as Claudin-1, ZO-1, and ZEB-1. The inhibition of Fak activity using the Fak inhibitor (PF-562281) restored the radiosensitivity in HER2-overexpressing cells. In conclusion, HER2 reduces the radiosensitivity of breast cancer by activating Fak in vitro and in vivo. Fak might be a potential target for the radiosensitization of HER2-overexpressed breast cancer.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-06-11", "authors": ["JingHou", "ZhiruiZhou", "XingxingChen", "RupingZhao", "ZhaozhiYang", "NaWei", "QingNi", "YanFeng", "XiaoliYu", "JinliMa", "XiaomaoGuo"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.9870\n10.18632/oncotarget.2397\n10.18632/oncotarget.3023"}

The goal of this study is to evaluate the discriminatory power of common genetic variants in breast cancer risk estimation. We conducted a retrospective case-control study drawing from an existing personalized medicine data repository. We collected variables that predict breast cancer risk: 153 high-frequency/low-penetrance genetic variants, reflecting the state-of-the-art GWAS on breast cancer, mammography descriptors and BI-RADS assessment categories in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon. We trained and tested na\u00efve Bayes models by using these predictive variables. We generated ROC curves and used the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to quantify predictive performance. We found that genetic variants achieved comparable predictive performance to BI-RADS assessment categories in terms of AUC (0.650 vs. 0.659, p-value = 0.742), but significantly lower predictive performance than the combination of BI-RADS assessment categories and mammography descriptors (0.650 vs. 0.751, p-value < 0.001).

To improve the diagnostic accuracy of microcalcifications, this study evaluates the performance of deep learning-based models on large datasets for its discrimination. A semi-automated segmentation method was used to characterize all microcalcifications. A discrimination classifier model was constructed to assess the accuracies of microcalcifications and breast masses, either in isolation or combination, for classifying breast lesions. Performances were compared to benchmark models. Our deep learning model achieved a discriminative accuracy of 87.3% if microcalcifications were characterized alone, compared to 85.8% with a support vector machine. The accuracies were 61.3% for both methods with masses alone and improved to 89.7% and 85.8% after the combined analysis with microcalcifications. Image segmentation with our deep learning model yielded 15, 26 and 41 features for the three scenarios, respectively. Overall, deep learning based on large datasets was superior to standard methods for the discrimination of microcalcifications. Accuracy was increased by adopting a combinatorial approach to detect microcalcifications and masses simultaneously.

In the current study, we determined the effects of AURKA inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor MLN8237 both as a monotherapy and in combination with the microtubule-targeting drug eribulin on different stages of metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and defined the potential mechanism of its action. MLN8237 as a single agent and in combination with eribulin affected multiple steps in the metastatic process, including migration, attachment, and proliferation in distant organs, resulting in suppression of metastatic colonization and recurrence of cancer. Eribulin application induces accumulation of active AURKA in TNBC cells, providing foundation for the combination therapy. Mechanistically, AURKA inhibition induces cytotoxic autophagy via activation of the LC3B/p62 axis and inhibition of pAKT, leading to eradication of metastases, but has no effect on growth of mammary tumor. Combination of MLN8237 with eribulin leads to a synergistic increase in apoptosis in mammary tumors, as well as cytotoxic autophagy in metastases. These preclinical data provide a new understanding of the mechanisms by which MLN8237 mediates its antimetastatic effects and advocates for its combination with eribulin in future clinical trials for metastatic breast cancer and early-stage solid tumors.

{"title": "Radiation-enhanced therapeutic targeting of galectin-1 enriched malignant stroma in triple negative breast cancer.", "abstract": "Currently there are no FDA approved targeted therapies for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Ongoing clinical trials for TNBC have focused primarily on targeting the epithelial cancer cells. However, targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads to the non-transformed tumor associated-endothelium can prove to be an alternate approach that is currently unexplored. The present study is supported by recent findings on elevated expression of stromal galectin-1 in clinical samples of TNBC and our ongoing findings on stromal targeting of radiation induced galectin-1 by the anginex-conjugated arsenic-cisplatin loaded liposomes using a novel murine tumor model. We demonstrate inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in response to the multimodal nanotherapeutic strategy using a TNBC model with orthotopic tumors originating from 3D tumor tissue analogs (TTA) comprised of tumor cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. The 'rigorous' combined treatment regimen of radiation and targeted liposomes is also shown to be well tolerated. More importantly, the results presented provide a means to exploit clinically relevant radiation dose for concurrent receptor mediated enhanced delivery of chemotherapy while limiting overall toxicity.

A total of 225 patients were enrolled: 33 in dose escalation and 192 in tumor-specific cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue. The maximum tolerated dose was 200 mg every 12 hours. The most common possibly related treatment-emergent adverse events involved fatigue and the gastrointestinal, renal, or hematopoietic systems. Plasma concentrations increased with dose, and pharmacodynamic effects were observed in proliferating keratinocytes and tumors. Radiographic responses were achieved in previously treated patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. For hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, the overall response rate was 31%; moreover, 61% of patients achieved either response or stable disease lasting \u22656 months.\nAbemaciclib represents the first selective inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 with a safety profile allowing continuous dosing to achieve sustained target inhibition.

{"title": "High-Level Clonal FGFR Amplification and Response to FGFR Inhibition in a Translational Clinical Trial.", "abstract": "FGFR1 and FGFR2 are amplified in many tumor types, yet what determines response to FGFR inhibition in amplified cancers is unknown. In a translational clinical trial, we show that gastric cancers with high-level clonal FGFR2 amplification have a high response rate to the selective FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, whereas cancers with subclonal or low-level amplification did not respond. Using cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, we show that high-level FGFR2 amplification initiates a distinct oncogene addiction phenotype, characterized by FGFR2-mediated transactivation of alternative receptor kinases, bringing PI3K/mTOR signaling under FGFR control. Signaling in low-level FGFR1-amplified cancers is more restricted to MAPK signaling, limiting sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. Finally, we show that circulating tumor DNA screening can identify high-level clonally amplified cancers. Our data provide a mechanistic understanding of the distinct pattern of oncogene addiction seen in highly amplified cancers and demonstrate the importance of clonality in predicting response to targeted therapy.\nRobust single-agent response to FGFR inhibition is seen only in high-level FGFR-amplified cancers, with copy-number level dictating response to FGFR inhibition in vitro, in vivo, and in the clinic. High-level amplification of FGFR2 is relatively rare in gastric and breast cancers, and we show that screening for amplification in circulating tumor DNA may present a viable strategy to screen patients.

These patients were matched with 379 corresponding patients who received BCS and RT with CF at a different center with respect to the year BCS was performed, patient age (\u00b13 years), and cancer stage. The AHF regimen consisted of 39\u200aGy in 13 fractions to the whole breast and a consecutive boost of 9 to 12\u200aGy in 3 to 4 fractions to the tumor bed.

{"title": "Targeting radioresistant breast cancer cells by single agent CHK1 inhibitor via enhancing replication stress.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) remains a standard therapeutic modality for breast cancer patients. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance limits the efficacy of RT. Here, we demonstrate that CHK1 inhibitor AZD7762 alone significantly inhibited the growth of radioresistant breast cancer cells (RBCC). Given the critical role of ATR/CHK1 signaling in suppressing oncogene-induced replication stress (RS), we hypothesize that CHK1 inhibition leads to the specific killing for RBCC due to its abrogation in the suppression of RS induced by oncogenes. In agreement, the expression of oncogenes c-Myc/CDC25A/c-Src/H-ras/E2F1 and DNA damage response (DDR) proteins ATR/CHK1/BRCA1/CtIP were elevated in RBCC. AZD7762 exposure led to significantly higher levels of RS in RBCC, compared to the parental cells. The mechanisms by which CHK1 inhibition led to specific increase of RS in RBCC were related to the interruptions in the replication fork dynamics and the homologous recombination (HR). In summary, RBCC activate oncogenic pathways and thus depend upon mechanisms controlled by CHK1 signaling to maintain RS under control for survival. Our study provided the first example where upregulating RS by CHK1 inhibitor contributes to the specific killing of RBCC, and highlight the importance of the CHK1 as a potential target for treatment of radioresistant cancer cells.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-05-12", "authors": ["YaoZhang", "JinzhiLai", "ZhanwenDu", "JinnanGao", "ShumingYang", "ShashankGorityala", "XiahuiXiong", "OuDeng", "ZhefuMa", "ChunhongYan", "GonzaloSusana", "YanXu", "JunranZhang"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.9156"}

We developed PET probes that provide a method of imaging this response in vivo, determining which tumors may use this escape pathway while avoiding the need for repeated biopsies.\nAnti-EGFR-F(ab')2 and anti-HER3-F(ab')2 were generated from monoclonal antibodies by enzymatic digestion, conjugated to DOTA, and labeled with (64)Cu. A panel of breast cancer cell lines was treated with increasing concentrations of the AKT inhibitor GDC-0068 or the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. Pre- and posttreatment expression of EGFR and HER3 was compared using Western blot and correlated to probe accumulation with binding studies. Nude mice xenografts of HCC-70 or MDA-MB-468 were treated with either AKT inhibitor or PI3K inhibitor and imaged with either EGFR or HER3 PET probe.\nChanges in HER3 and EGFR PET probe accumulation correlate to RTK expression change as assessed by Western blot (R(2) of 0.85-0.98). EGFR PET probe PET/CT imaging of HCC70 tumors shows an SUV of 0.32 \u00b1 0.03 for vehicle-, 0.50 \u00b1 0.01 for GDC-0941-, and 0.62 \u00b1 0.01 for GDC-0068-treated tumors, respectively (P < 0.01 for both comparisons to vehicle).

{"title": "Targeting the epigenetics of the DNA damage response in breast cancer.", "abstract": "Cancer is as much an epigenetic disease as it is a genetic disease, and epigenetic alterations in cancer often serve as potent surrogates for genetic mutations. Because the epigenetic factors involved in the DNA damage response are regulated by multiple elements, therapies to target specific components of the epigenetic machinery can be inefficient. In contrast, therapies aimed at inhibiting the methionine cycle can indirectly inhibit both DNA and protein methylation, and the wide variety of genes and pathways that are affected by these methylations make this global strategy very attractive. In the present study, we propose an adjuvant therapy that targets the epigenetics of the DNA damage response in breast cancer cells and that results in efficient apoptosis and a reduction in distant metastases in vivo. We observed that a combined therapy designed to uncouple adenosine metabolism using dipyridamole in the presence of a new synthetic antifolate, 3-O-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-(-)-catechin, simultaneously and efficiently blocked both the folic cycle and the methionine cycle in breast cancer cells and sensitized these cells to radiotherapy. The treatment impeded the recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to the chromatin regions flanking DNA double-strand breaks and thereby avoided the DNA damage responses in breast cancer cells that were exposed to ionizing radiation. In addition, this hypomethylating therapy was also efficient in reducing the self-renewal capability of breast cancer-initiating cells and induced reversion of mesenchymal phenotypes in breast cancer cells.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2016-04-08", "authors": ["M FMontenegro", "RGonz\u00e1lez-Guerrero", "LS\u00e1nchez-del-Campo", "APi\u00f1ero-Madrona", "JCabezas-Herrera", "J NRodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez"], "doi": "10.1038/cddis.2016.85"}

These tumors are especially resistant to currently available treatments due to multiple factors. However, the combination of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified immune cells and oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) has not yet been explored in this context. In this study, NK-92 cells and primary NK cells were engineered to express the second generation of EGFR-CAR. The efficacies of anti-BCBMs of EGFR-CAR NK cells, oHSV-1, and their combination were tested in vitro and in a breast cancer intracranial mouse model. In vitro, compared with mock-transduced NK-92 cells or primary NK cells, EGFR-CAR-engineered NK-92 cells and primary NK cells displayed enhanced cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production when co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7. oHSV-1 alone was also capable of lysing and destroying these cells. However, a higher cytolytic effect of EGFR-CAR NK-92 cells was observed when combined with oHSV-1 compared to the monotherapies. In the mice intracranially pre-inoculated with EGFR-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells, intratumoral administration of either EGFR-CAR-transduced NK-92 cells or oHSV-1 mitigated tumor growth. Notably, the combination of EGFR-CAR NK-92 cells with oHSV-1 resulted in more efficient killing of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells and significantly longer survival of tumor-bearing mice when compared to monotherapies. These results demonstrate that regional administration of EGFR-CAR NK-92 cells combined with oHSV-1 therapy is a potentially promising strategy to treat BCBMs.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-04-07", "authors": ["XilinChen", "JianfengHan", "JianhongChu", "LinglingZhang", "JianyingZhang", "CharlieChen", "LuxiChen", "YouweiWang", "HongweiWang", "LongYi", "J BradleyElder", "Qi-EnWang", "XiaomingHe", "BalveenKaur", "E AntonioChiocca", "JianhuaYu"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.8526\n10.1038/srep11483"}

Currently, identifying new therapies that selectively inhibit tumor growth without damaging normal tissue are a major challenge of cancer research. One of the features of cancer cells is that they do not consume more oxygen even under normal oxygen circumstances but prefer to aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose and glutamine. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms of the radioresistance in breast cancer cells.\nHuman breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were treated with radiation alone, Glut1 inhibitor alone or the combination of both to evaluate cell glucose metabolism and apoptosis. By the establishment of radioresistant cell line, we investigate the mechanisms of the combined treatments of radiation with Glut1 inhibitor in the radioresistant cells.\nThe glucose metabolism and the expression of Glut1 are significantly stimulated by radiotherapy. We report the radioresistant breast cancer cells exhibit upregulated Glut1 expression and glucose metabolism. In addition, we observed overexpression of Glut1 renders breast cancer cells resistant to radiation and knocking down of Glut1 sensitizes breast cancer cells to radiation. We treated breast cancer cells with radiation and WZB117 which inhibits Glut1 expression and glucose metabolism and found the combination of WZB117 and radiation exhibits synergistically inhibitory effects on breast cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate the inhibition of Glut1 re-sensitizes the radioresistant cancer cells to radiation.\nThis study reveals the roles of Glut1 in the radiosensitivity of human breast cancer.

We used a hypothetical Markov cohort model of lifetime duration for 60-year-old women with early stage breast cancer receiving AIs.

Two eligibility scenarios for AR therapy were considered: (A) osteoporosis and (B) osteopenia or osteoporosis. The main outcomes were incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years gained and cumulative fractures per 1000 women, calculated relative to the comparator. Key aspects of the model were explored in sensitivity analyses. Due to relatively low effectiveness gains, the outcomes were primarily driven by the costs. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was A$47,556 and A$253,000 for scenarios A and B, respectively. The numbers of fractures avoided were 56 and 77 per 1000 women, respectively. The results were most sensitive to the initial probability of osteoporosis, baseline risk of fracture, and cohort starting age.

{"title": "Blockade of AP-1 Potentiates Endocrine Therapy and Overcomes Resistance.", "abstract": "The transcription factor AP-1 is downstream of growth factor (GF) receptors (GFRs) and stress-related kinases, both of which are implicated in breast cancer endocrine resistance. Previously, we have suggested that acquired endocrine resistance is associated with increased activity of AP-1 in an in vivo model. In this report, we provide direct evidence for the role of AP-1 in endocrine resistance. First, significant overlap was found between genes modulated in tamoxifen resistance and a gene signature associated with GF-induced estrogen receptor (ER) cistrome. Interestingly, these overlapping genes were enriched for key signaling components of GFRs and stress-related kinases and had AP-1 motifs in their promoters/enhancers. Second, to determine a more definitive role of AP-1 in endocrine resistance, AP-1 was inhibited using an inducible dominant-negative (DN) cJun expressed in MCF7 breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo AP-1 blockade enhanced the antiproliferative effect of endocrine treatments in vitro, accelerated xenograft tumor response to tamoxifen and estrogen deprivation in vivo, promoted complete regression of tumors, and delayed the onset of tamoxifen resistance. Induction of DN-cJun after the development of tamoxifen resistance resulted in dramatic tumor shrinkage, accompanied by reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. These data suggest that AP-1 is a key determinant of endocrine resistance by mediating a global shift in the ER transcriptional program.\nAP-1 represents a viable therapeutic target to overcome endocrine resistance.

Since the molecular causes for fibrosis are largely unknown, we analyse if epigenetic regulation might explain inter-individual differences in fibrosis risk. DNA methylation profiling of dermal fibroblasts obtained from breast cancer patients prior to irradiation identifies differences associated with fibrosis. One region is characterized as a differentially methylated enhancer of diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA). Decreased DNA methylation at this enhancer enables recruitment of the profibrotic transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1) and facilitates radiation-induced DGKA transcription in cells from patients later developing fibrosis. Conversely, inhibition of DGKA has pronounced effects on diacylglycerol-mediated lipid homeostasis and reduces profibrotic fibroblast activation.

Compared to conventional whole breast irradiation that takes 5 to 6 weeks, APBI is reported to induce worse cosmetic outcomes both when using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). These late normal tissue effects may be attributed to the dose volume effect because a large portion of the non-target breast tissue volume (NTBTV) receives a high dose. In the context of APBI, non-coplanar beams could spare the NTBTV more efficiently. This study evaluates the dosimetric benefit of using the Cyberknife (CK) for APBI in comparison to IMRT (Tomotherapy) and three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT).\nThe possibility of using surgical clips, implanted during surgery, to track target movements is investigated first. A phantom of a female thorax was designed in-house using the measurements of 20 patients. Surgical clips of different sizes were inserted inside the breast. A treatment plan was delivered to the mobile and immobile phantom. The motion compensation accuracy was evaluated using three radiochromic films inserted inside the breast. Three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), Tomotherapy (TOMO) and CK treatment plans were calculated for 10 consecutive patients who received APBI in Lille. To ensure a fair comparison of the three techniques, margins applied to the CTV were set to 10 mm. However, a second CK plan was prepared using 3 mm margins to evaluate the benefits of motion compensation.\nOnly the larger clips (VITALITEC Medium-Large) could be tracked inside the larger breast (all gamma indices below 1 for 1 % of the maximum dose and 1 mm). All techniques meet the guidelines defined in the NSABP/RTOG and SHARE protocols. As the applied dose volume constraints are very strong, insignificant dosimetric differences exist between techniques regarding the PTV coverage and the sparing of the lung and heart. However, the CK may be used to reduce high doses received by the NTBTV more efficiently.\nRobotic stereotactic radiotherapy may be used for APBI to more efficiently spare the NTBTV and improve cosmetic results of APBI.", "journal": "Radiation oncology (London, England)", "date": "2016-02-28", "authors": ["ErwannRault", "ThomasLacornerie", "Hong-PhuongDang", "FrederikCrop", "EricLartigau", "NickReynaert", "DavidPasquier"], "doi": "10.1186/s13014-016-0607-9\n10.1200/JCO.2013.50.5511\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.01.059\n10.1177/153303461000900501\n10.1177/153303461000900502\n10.1088/0031-9155/50/4/007\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.09.009\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.11.053\n10.1118/1.598248\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.06.052\n10.1016/j.prro.2013.08.001\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.12.040\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.03.005"}

Crizotinib and ceritinib, a next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) active against crizotinib-refractory patients, are clinically available for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, and multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs are currently under clinical evaluation. These ALK-TKIs exhibit robust clinical activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients; however, the emergence of ALK-TKI resistance restricts the therapeutic effect. To date, various secondary mutations or bypass pathway activation-mediated resistance have been identified, but large parts of the resistance mechanism are yet to be identified. Here, we report the discovery of p-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) overexpression as a ceritinib resistance mechanism in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. P-gp exported ceritinib and its overexpression conferred ceritinib and crizotinib resistance, but not to PF-06463922 or alectinib, which are next-generation ALK inhibitors. Knockdown of ABCB1 or P-gp inhibitors sensitizes the patient-derived cancer cells to ceritinib, in vitro and in vivo. P-gp overexpression was identified in three out of 11 cases with in ALK-rearranged crizotinib or ceritinib resistant NSCLC patients. Our study suggests that alectinib, PF-06463922, or P-gp inhibitor with ceritinib could overcome the ceritinib or crizotinib resistance mediated by P-gp overexpression.", "journal": "EBioMedicine", "date": "2016-02-13", "authors": ["RyoheiKatayama", "TakuyaSakashita", "NorikoYanagitani", "HironoriNinomiya", "AtsushiHoriike", "LucFriboulet", "Justin FGainor", "NorikoMotoi", "AkitoDobashi", "SeijiSakata", "YuichiTambo", "SatoruKitazono", "ShigeoSato", "SumieKoike", "AJohn Iafrate", "MariMino-Kenudson", "YuichiIshikawa", "Alice TShaw", "Jeffrey AEngelman", "KengoTakeuchi", "MakotoNishio", "NaoyaFujita"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.12.009"}
{"title": "Resistance Exercise and Inflammation in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Adjuvant Radiation Therapy: Mediation Analysis From a Randomized, Controlled Intervention Trial.", "abstract": "To explore the mediating role of inflammatory parameters in the development of fatigue, pain, and potentially related depressive symptoms during radiation therapy for breast cancer and its mitigation by resistance exercise.\nBreast cancer patients scheduled for adjuvant radiation therapy were randomized to 12-week progressive resistance exercise training (EX) or a relaxation control group. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were measured in serum samples collected before, at the end, and 6 weeks after radiation therapy from 103 chemotherapy-na\u00efve participants. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire, pain with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30, and depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Analysis of covariance models, partial correlations, Freedman-Schatzkin tests, and R(2) effect-size measures for mediation were calculated.\nThe analysis of covariance models revealed a significant intervention effect on IL-6 (P=.010) and the IL-6/IL-1ra ratio (P=.018), characterized by a marked increase during radiation therapy among controls, but no significant change in EX. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist did not change significantly in either group (P=.88). Increased IL-6 and IL-6/IL-1ra levels at the end of radiation therapy were significantly associated with increased physical fatigue and pain 6 weeks after radiation. We observed significant partial mediation by IL-6 and IL-6/IL-1ra of the effect of resistance exercise on physical fatigue (Freedman-Schatzkin P=.023 and P<.001) and pain (both P<.001). Hereby IL-6 and IL-6/IL-1ra mediated between 15% and 24% of the variance of physical fatigue and pain explained by the intervention.\nThis randomized, controlled trial showed a significantly increased proinflammatory cytokine level after adjuvant radiation therapy in breast cancer patients. This effect was counteracted by progressive resistance exercise training. Interleukin-6 and the IL-6/IL-1ra ratio seemed to mediate the beneficial effect of exercise on physical fatigue and pain but only to a small extent.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2016-02-09", "authors": ["Martina ESchmidt", "AnnaMeynk\u00f6hn", "NinaHabermann", "JoachimWiskemann", "JanOelmann", "HolgerHof", "SabineWessels", "OliverKlassen", "J\u00fcrgenDebus", "KarinPotthoff", "KarenSteindorf", "Cornelia MUlrich"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.10.058"}
{"title": "Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) 022: A Phase II Trial of Neratinib for Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Breast Cancer and Brain Metastases.", "abstract": "Evidence-based treatments for metastatic, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer in the CNS are limited. Neratinib is an irreversible inhibitor of erbB1, HER2, and erbB4, with promising activity in HER2-positive breast cancer; however, its activity in the CNS is unknown. We evaluated the efficacy of treatment with neratinib in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases in a multicenter, phase II open-label trial.\nEligible patients were those with HER2-positive brain metastases (\u2265 1 cm in longest dimension) who experienced progression in the CNS after one or more line of CNS-directed therapy, such as whole-brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and/or surgical resection. Patients received neratinib 240 mg orally once per day, and tumors were assessed every two cycles. The primary endpoint was composite CNS objective response rate (ORR), requiring all of the following: \u2265 50% reduction in volumetric sum of target CNS lesions and no progression of non-target lesions, new lesions, escalating corticosteroids, progressive neurologic signs/symptoms, or non-CNS progression--the threshold for success was five of 40 responders.\nForty patients were enrolled between February 2012 and June 2013; 78% of patients had previous whole-brain radiotherapy. Three women achieved a partial response (CNS objective response rate, 8%; 95% CI, 2% to 22%). The median number of cycles received was two (range, one to seven cycles), with a median progression-free survival of 1.9 months. Five women received six or more cycles. The most common grade \u2265 3 event was diarrhea (occurring in 21% of patients taking prespecified loperamide prophylaxis and 28% of those without prophylaxis). Patients in the study experienced a decreased quality of life over time.\nAlthough neratinib had low activity and did not meet our threshold for success, 12.5% of patients received six or more cycles.

{"title": "Classification of fibroglandular tissue distribution in the breast based on radiotherapy planning CT.", "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of breast tissues is required for a number of applications such as model based deformable registration in breast radiotherapy. The accuracy of breast tissue segmentation is affected by the spatial distribution (or pattern) of fibroglandular tissue (FT). The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate texture features, determined from planning computed tomography (CT) data, to classify the spatial distribution of FT in the breast.\nPlanning CT data of 23 patients were evaluated in this study. Texture features were derived from the radial glandular fraction (RGF), which described the distribution of FT within three breast regions (posterior, middle, and anterior). Using visual assessment, experts grouped patients according to FT spatial distribution: sparse or non-sparse. Differences in the features between the two groups were investigated using the Wilcoxon rank test. Classification performance of the features was evaluated for a range of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers.\nExperts found eight patients and 15 patients had sparse and non-sparse spatial distribution of FT, respectively. A large proportion of features (>9 of 13) from the individual breast regions had significant differences (p <0.05) between the sparse and non-sparse group. The features from middle region had most significant differences and gave the highest classification accuracy for all the SVM kernels investigated. Overall, the features from middle breast region achieved highest accuracy (91%) with the linear SVM kernel.\nThis study found that features based on radial glandular fraction provide a means for discriminating between fibroglandular tissue distributions and could achieve a classification accuracy of 91%.", "journal": "BMC medical imaging", "date": "2016-01-15", "authors": ["PrabhjotJuneja", "PhilipEvans", "DavidWindridge", "EmmaHarris"], "doi": "10.1186/s12880-016-0107-2\n10.1093/jnci/88.22.1659\n10.1016/j.clon.2004.08.010\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.05.014\n10.1109/TBME.2007.893493\n10.1118/1.3567147\n10.1016/j.radonc.2010.05.014\n10.1016/j.radonc.2010.11.005\n10.2214/ajr.126.6.1130\n10.1007/s10278-007-9093-9\n10.1118/1.1355308\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-0631\n10.1118/1.3271346"}
{"title": "STAT3-survivin signaling mediates a poor response to radiotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancers.", "abstract": "Although radiotherapy resistance is associated with locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis in breast cancers, clinically relevant molecular markers and critical signaling pathways of radioresistant breast cancer are yet to be defined. Herein, we show that HER2-STAT3-survivin regulation is associated with radiotherapy resistance in HER2-positive breast cancers. Depletion of HER2 by siRNA sensitized HER2-positive breast cancer cells to irradiation by decreasing STAT3 activity and survivin, a STAT3 target gene, expression in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3 activation or depletion of survivin also sensitized HER2-positive breast cancer cells to irradiation, suggesting that the HER2-STAT3-survivin axis is a key pathway in radiotherapy resistance of HER2-positive breast cancer cells. In addition, our clinical analysis demonstrated the association between HER2-positive breast cancers and radiotherapy resistance. Notably, we found that increased expression of phosphorylated STAT3, STAT3, and survivin correlated with a poor response to radiotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer tissues. These findings suggest that the HER2-STAT3-survivin axis might serve as a predictive marker and therapeutic target to overcome radiotherapy resistance in HER2-positive breast cancers.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2016-01-13", "authors": ["Jae-SungKim", "Hyun-AhKim", "Min-KiSeong", "HyesilSeol", "Jeong SuOh", "Eun-KyuKim", "Jong WookChang", "Sang-GuHwang", "Woo ChulNoh"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.6855\n10.18632/oncotarget.3042\n10.18632/oncotarget.2135"}

The purpose of this study was to compare patients with MBC with clinicopathologic and treatment-matched patients with triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) in terms of response to treatment, progression, and survival.Fifty-four patients with MBC and 51 with TNBC, who were treated at Istanbul University, Institute of Oncology, between 1993 and 2014, were included in the study. After correctly matching the patients with 1 of the 2 groups, they were compared to determine differences in response to treatment, disease progression, clinical course, and survival.At a median follow-up of 28 months, 18 patients (17.1%) died and 27 (25.5%) had disease progression. Metaplastic histology was significantly correlated with worse 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) (51\u200a\u00b1\u200a9% vs. 82\u200a\u00b1\u200a6%, P\u200a=\u200a0.013) and overall survival (OS) (68\u200a\u00b1\u200a8% vs. 94\u200a\u00b1\u200a4%, P\u200a=\u200a0.009) compared with TNBC histology.

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation is one of the most frequent events in human malignancies, and is critical for sustaining the self\u2011renewing ability of cancer stem cells (CSCs); inhibition by rapamycin is an effective and promising strategy in anticancer treatments. In the present study, we found that mTOR activity was closely related to the self-renewal ability of BrCSCs, and in triple negative MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB\u2011468 cells, rapamycin repression of mTOR phosphorylation decreased the number of mammospheres and helped to sensitize the resistant CSCs to low-dose radiation therapy. By inhibiting mTOR and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), we confirmed that rapamycin functioned through the mTOR/MnSOD/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway, and the existence of Akt governed the rapamycin\u2011induced asymmetric division (AD) of stem cells in cases of radiation\u2011treated breast cancer. The synergic effects of rapamycin and low-dose radiation induced the AD of stem cells, which then resulted in a decrease in the number of mammospheres, and both were mediated by MnSOD. Governed by Akt, the consequent inhibition of ROS formation and oxidative stress preserved the AD mode of stem cells, which is critical for an improved radiotherapy response in clinical treatment, as the tumor group is thus easier to eliminate with radiation therapy. We posit that an in-depth understanding of the interaction of radiation with CSCs has enormous potential and will make radiation even better and more effective.", "journal": "International journal of molecular medicine", "date": "2015-12-29", "authors": ["YuanhuiLai", "XinpeiYu", "XiaohongLin", "ShanyangHe"], "doi": "10.3892/ijmm.2015.2441\n10.1038/mt.2012.180\n10.1111/jcmm.12432\n10.1016/j.stem.2012.06.007\n10.1016/j.stem.2009.06.017\n10.2174/092986711796011201\n10.1038/srep03230\n10.1038/onc.2013.492\n10.1038/ncomms7053\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1233\n10.1073/pnas.1221055110\n10.5732/cjc.011.10186\n10.1038/nature05236\n10.1093/jnci/djj495\n10.1073/pnas.0606599104\n10.1593/tlo.10247\n10.1038/nature07733\n10.1073/pnas.1109632108\n10.1002/stem.318\n10.3109/09553002.2014.892227\n10.1111/jcmm.12522\n10.4161/cc.10.7.15210\n10.1186/1476-4598-13-137\n10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0216-11.2011\n10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00247-7\n10.3390/ijms141122409\n10.1667/RR3235\n10.1016/j.molonc.2010.06.005\n10.1038/bjc.2013.642\n10.1073/pnas.1206268109\n10.1016/j.febslet.2010.03.040\n10.1089/ars.2012.4529\n10.1038/nrm3772\n10.1101/gad.1850809\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0474\n10.3322/caac.20107\n10.1002/stem.1058\n10.1667/RR3034.1\n10.18632/oncotarget.2133\n10.18632/oncotarget.3535\n10.1111/jcmm.12122\n10.1111/jcmm.12162\n10.1016/j.mrrev.2008.06.001\n10.1073/pnas.1217072110\n10.1016/B978-0-12-420117-0.00001-3"}

Full efficacy required Il-12, Ifn-\u03b3, adaptive immunity and neutrophils. Inhaled CPMV nanoparticles were rapidly taken up by and activated neutrophils in the tumour microenvironment as an important part of the antitumour immune response. CPMV also exhibited clear treatment efficacy and systemic antitumour immunity in ovarian, colon, and breast tumour models in multiple anatomic locations. CPMV nanoparticles are stable, nontoxic, modifiable with drugs and antigens, and their nanomanufacture is highly scalable.

{"title": "Validation of a novel robot-assisted 3DUS system for real-time planning and guidance of breast interstitial HDR brachytherapy.", "abstract": "In current clinical practice, there is no integrated 3D ultrasound (3DUS) guidance system clinically available for breast brachytherapy. In this study, the authors present a novel robot-assisted 3DUS system for real-time planning and guidance of breast interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment.\nFor this work, a new computer controlled robotic 3DUS system was built to perform a hybrid motion scan, which is a combination of a 6 cm linear translation with a 30\u00b0 rotation at both ends. The new 3DUS scanner was designed to fit on a modified Kuske assembly, keeping the current template grid configuration but modifying the frame to allow the mounting of the 3DUS system at several positions. A finer grid was also tested. A user interface was developed to perform image reconstruction, semiautomatic segmentation of the surgical bed as well as catheter reconstruction and tracking. A 3D string phantom was used to validate the geometric accuracy of the reconstruction. The volumetric accuracy of the system was validated with phantoms using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) images. In order to accurately determine whether 3DUS can effectively replace CT for treatment planning, the authors have compared the 3DUS catheter reconstruction to the one obtained from CT images. In addition, in agarose-based phantoms, an end-to-end procedure was performed by executing six independent complete procedures with both 14 and 16 catheters, and for both standard and finer Kuske grids. Finally, in phantoms, five end-to-end procedures were performed with the final CT planning for the validation of 3DUS preplanning.\nThe 3DUS acquisition time is approximately 10 s. A paired Student t-test showed that there was no statistical significant difference between known and measured values of string separations in each direction. Both MRI and CT volume measurements were not statistically different from 3DUS volume (Student t-test: p > 0.05) and they were significantly correlated to 3DUS measurement (Pearson test: MRI p < 0.05 and CT p < 0.001). The mean angular separation distance between catheter trajectories segmented from 3DUS and CT images was 0.42\u00b0 \u00b1 0.24\u00b0, while the maximum and mean trajectory separations were 0.51 \u00b1 0.19 and 0.37 \u00b1 0.17 mm, respectively. Overall, the new finer grid has performed significantly better in terms of dosimetric indices. The planning target volume dosimetric indices were not found statistically different between 3DUS and CT planning (Student t-test, p > 0.05). Both the skin and the pectoral muscle dosimetric indices were within ABS guidelines.\nA novel robot-assisted 3DUS system was designed and validated. To their knowledge, this is the first system capable of performing real-time guidance and planning of breast multicatheter HDR brachytherapy treatments.

We introduce here [(68)Ga]SB3, a [(99m)Tc]DB1 mimic-carrying, instead of the (99m)Tc-binding tetraamine, the chelator DOTA for labeling with the PET radiometal (68)Ga.\nCompetition binding assays of SB3 and [(nat)Ga]SB3 were conducted against [(125)I-Tyr(4)]BBN in PC-3 cell membranes. Blood samples collected 5 min postinjection (pi) of the [(67)Ga]SB3 surrogate in mice were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for degradation products. Likewise, biodistribution was performed after injection of [(67)Ga]SB3 (37 kBq, 100 \u03bcL, 10 pmol peptide) in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing PC-3 xenografts. Eventually, [(68)Ga]SB3 (283\u2009\u00b1\u200991 MBq, 23\u2009\u00b1\u20097 nmol) was injected into 17 patients with breast (8) and prostate (9) cancer.

[(67)Ga]SB3 showed high, GRPR-specific and prolonged retention in PC-3 xenografts (33.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9%ID/g at 1 h pi - 27.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9%ID/g at 24 h pi), but much faster clearance from the GRPR-rich pancreas (\u2248160%ID/g at 1 h pi to <17%ID/g at 24 h pi) in mice. In patients, [(68)Ga]SB3 elicited no adverse effects and clearly visualized cancer lesions. Thus, 4 out of 8 (50 %) breast cancer and 5 out of 9 (55 %) prostate cancer patients showed pathological uptake on PET/CT with [(68)Ga]SB3.\n[(67)Ga]SB3 showed excellent pharmacokinetics in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice, while [(68)Ga]SB3 PET/CT visualized lesions in about 50 % of patients with advanced and metastasized prostate and breast cancer.

Women older than 18 years with histologically confirmed HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and CNS recurrence or progression as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) during or after treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or both, were eligible.

Treatment assignment was not masked for clinicians or patients, but the trial team was masked until database lock to reduce bias. The primary endpoint, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, was patient benefit at 12 weeks, defined by an absence of CNS or extra-CNS disease progression, no tumour-related worsening of neurological signs or symptoms, and no increase in corticosteroid dose. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of a study drug. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01441596.\nBetween Dec 22, 2011, and Feb 12, 2013, we screened 132 patients, of whom 121 were eligible and randomly assigned to treatment: 40 to afatinib alone, 38 to afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 43 to investigator's choice.

This phase I study aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ralimetinib, as a single agent and in combination with tamoxifen, when administered orally to patients with advanced cancer.\nThe study design consisted of a dose-escalation phase performed in a 3+3 design (Part A; n = 54), two dose-confirmation phases [Part B at 420 mg (n = 18) and Part C at 300 mg (n = 8)], and a tumor-specific expansion phase in combination with tamoxifen for women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer refractory to aromatase inhibitors (Part D; n = 9).

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the relationship between adipocytokines and body composition as well as the effects of TMX and AIs on plasma adiponectin, leptin, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) and body composition.\nPatients were treated with either TMX or AI according to their menopausal status after adjuvant radiotherapy. Changes in body composition and serum leptin and adiponectin levels were evaluated. We recorded the type of hormonal therapy, BMI, waist/hip ratio (WHR), leptin and adiponectin levels at study entry, and after 6 and 12 months.\nFrom baseline to the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, there were statistically significant increases in WHR (p = 0.003), fat mass (p = 0.041), and serum leptin (p < 0.001) and adiponectin levels (p < 0.001). The changes in body composition and serum leptin and adiponectin levels were similar in TMX and AI groups. A statistically significant decrease was found in total body water and LAR (p < 0.001). Although weight and body fat percentage increased, such increases were not statistically significant. A positive correlation was found between baseline BMI and serum leptin levels. This correlation was maintained at 6 and 12 months. The negative correlation found between serum adiponectin levels at baseline and baseline BMI did not last throughout the study.\nIn this study, increased leptin and adiponectin levels and a decreased LAR were found in both AI and TMX groups. These changes might have occurred through both mechanisms of hormonal therapy and body composition changes. Therefore, AIs and TMX may exert their protective effects for BC patients by decreasing LAR rather than affecting leptin or adiponectin alone.", "journal": "Chemotherapy", "date": "2015-11-17", "authors": ["MuratAkyol", "LeylaDemir", "AhmetAlacacioglu", "H\u00fclyaEllidokuz", "YukselKucukzeybek", "YasarYildiz", "ZehraGumus", "VedatBayoglu", "IbrahimYildiz", "Tar\u0131kSalman", "UmutVarol", "BetulKucukzeybek", "LutfiyeDemir", "AhmetDirican", "RecepSutcu", "Mustafa OktayTarhan"], "doi": "10.1159/000440944"}

Here, we explored the potential connection between Chk-\u03b1 and autophagy in the mechanisms driving to tamoxifen (TAM) resistance, in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer cells (BCCs). Human BCC lines (MCF-7 and TAM-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/TAM) cells) were used. Chk-\u03b1 expression and activity was suppressed by the transduction of shRNA (shChk-\u03b1) with lentivirus and treatment with CK37, a Chk-\u03b1 inhibitor. MCF-7/TAM cells had higher Chk-\u03b1 expression and phosphocholine levels than MCF-7 cells. A specific downregulation of Chk-\u03b1 by the transduction of shChk-\u03b1 exhibited a significant decrease in phosphocholine levels in MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cells. The autophagy-related protein, cleaved microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagosome-like structures were significantly increased in shChk-\u03b1-transduced or CK37-treated MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cells. The downregulation of Chk-\u03b1 attenuated the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, and mTOR in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/TAM cells. In MCF-7 cells, the downregulation of Chk-\u03b1 resulted in an induction of autophagy, a decreased proliferation ability and an activation of caspase-3. In MCF-7/TAM cells, despite a significant decrease in proliferation ability and an increase in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, the downregulation of Chk-\u03b1 did not induced caspase-dependent cell death and further enhanced autophagy and G0/G1 phase arrest. An autophagy inhibitor, methyladenine (3-MA) induced death and attenuated the level of elevated LC3 in MCF-7/TAM cells.

{"title": "Anticancer therapeutic potential of Mn porphyrin/ascorbate system.", "abstract": "Ascorbate (Asc) as a single agent suppressed growth of several tumor cell lines in a mouse model. It has been tested in a Phase I Clinical Trial on pancreatic cancer patients where it exhibited no toxicity to normal tissue yet was of only marginal efficacy. The mechanism of its anticancer effect was attributed to the production of tumoricidal hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during ascorbate oxidation catalyzed by endogenous metalloproteins. The amount of H2O2 could be maximized with exogenous catalyst that has optimized properties for such function and is localized within tumor. Herein we studied 14 Mn porphyrins (MnPs) which differ vastly with regards to their redox properties, charge, size/bulkiness and lipophilicity. Such properties affect the in vitro and in vivo ability of MnPs (i) to catalyze ascorbate oxidation resulting in the production of H2O2; (ii) to subsequently employ H2O2 in the catalysis of signaling proteins oxidations affecting cellular survival pathways; and (iii) to accumulate at site(s) of interest. The metal-centered reduction potential of MnPs studied, E1/2 of Mn(III)P/Mn(II)P redox couple, ranged from -200 to +350 mV vs NHE. Anionic and cationic, hydrophilic and lipophilic as well as short- and long-chained and bulky compounds were explored. Their ability to catalyze ascorbate oxidation, and in turn cytotoxic H2O2 production, was explored via spectrophotometric and electrochemical means. Bell-shape structure-activity relationship (SAR) was found between the initial rate for the catalysis of ascorbate oxidation, vo(Asc)ox and E1/2, identifying cationic Mn(III) N-substituted pyridylporphyrins with E1/2>0 mV vs NHE as efficient catalysts for ascorbate oxidation. The anticancer potential of MnPs/Asc system was subsequently tested in cellular (human MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and mouse 4T1) and animal models of breast cancer. At the concentrations where ascorbate (1mM) and MnPs (1 or 5 \u00b5M) alone did not trigger any alteration in cell viability, combined treatment suppressed cell viability up to 95%. No toxicity was observed with normal human breast epithelial HBL-100 cells. Bell-shape relationship, essentially identical to vo(Asc)oxvs E1/2, was also demonstrated between MnP/Asc-controlled cytotoxicity and E1/2-controlled vo(Asc)ox. Magnetic resonance imaging studies were conducted to explore the impact of ascorbate on T1-relaxivity. The impact of MnP/Asc on intracellular thiols and on GSH/GSSG and Cys/CySS ratios in 4T1 cells was assessed and cellular reduction potentials were calculated. The data indicate a significant increase in cellular oxidative stress induced by MnP/Asc. Based on vo(Asc)oxvs E1/2 relationships and cellular toxicity, MnTE-2-PyP(5+) was identified as the best catalyst among MnPs studied. Asc and MnTE-2-PyP(5+) were thus tested in a 4T1 mammary mouse flank tumor model. The combination of ascorbate (4 g/kg) and MnTE-2-PyP(5+) (0.2mg/kg) showed significant suppression of tumor growth relative to either MnTE-2-PyP(5+) or ascorbate alone. About 7-fold higher accumulation of MnTE-2-PyP(5+) in tumor vs normal tissue was found to contribute largely to the anticancer effect.", "journal": "Free radical biology & medicine", "date": "2015-10-27", "authors": ["ArtakTovmasyan", "Romulo SSampaio", "Mary-KearaBoss", "Jacqueline CBueno-Janice", "Bader HBader", "MiliniThomas", "Julio SReboucas", "MichaelOrr", "Joshua DChandler", "Young-MiGo", "Dean PJones", "Talaignair NVenkatraman", "SinisaHaberle", "NataliaKyui", "Christopher DLascola", "Mark WDewhirst", "IvanSpasojevic", "LudmilBenov", "InesBatinic-Haberle"], "doi": "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2015.10.416"}
{"title": "Inhibition of Fatty Acid Synthase Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy.", "abstract": "Many common human cancers, including colon, prostate and breast cancer, express high levels of fatty acid synthase compared to normal human tissues. This elevated expression is associated with protection against apoptosis, increased metastasis and poor prognosis. Inhibitors of fatty acid synthase, such as the cerulenin synthetic analog C75, decrease prostate cancer cell proliferation, increase apoptosis and decrease tumor growth in experimental models. Although radiotherapy is widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer patients, the risk of damage to neighboring normal organs limits the radiation dose that can be delivered. In this study, we examined the potential of fatty acid synthase inhibition to sensitize prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy. The efficacy of C75 alone or in combination with X irradiation was examined in monolayers and in multicellular tumor spheroids. Treatment with C75 alone decreased clonogenic survival, an effect that was abrogated by the antioxidant. C75 treatment also delayed spheroid growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The radiosensitizing effect of C75 was indicated by combination index values between 0.65 and 0.71 and the reduced surviving fraction of clonogens, in response to 2 Gy X irradiation, from 0.51 to 0.30 and 0.11 in the presence of 25 and 35 \u03bcM C75, respectively. This increased sensitivity to radiation was reduced by the presence of the antioxidant. The C75 treatment also enhanced the spheroid growth delay induced by X irradiation in a supra-additive manner. The level of radiation-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells was increased further by C75, which induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, but only at a concentration greater than that required for radiosensitization. Radiation-induced G2/M blockade was not affected by C75 treatment. These results suggest the potential use of fatty acid synthase inhibition to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy of prostate carcinoma and that C75-dependent cell cycle arrest is not responsible for its radiosensitizing effect.", "journal": "Radiation research", "date": "2015-10-21", "authors": ["ColinRae", "UweHaberkorn", "John WBabich", "Robert JMairs"], "doi": "10.1667/RR14173.1"}

Pre-clinically, radio-sensitization by inhibition of Chk1 activation by ATR inhibitor (VE-821) and inhibition of Chk1 (V158411) were investigated in MDA-MB-231 (p53 mutant) and MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) breast cancer cells. In the whole cohort, 208/1755 patients (11.9%) developed local recurrence of which 126 (61%) developed local recurrence within 5 years of initiation of primary therapy.

However, further improvement of its therapeutic efficacy is required. In this study, the authors show a transcriptomic approach to identify potential targets for enhancing the cytotoxic effects of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS. They generated two types of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS harboring different numbers of NLS peptides, (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS-S and -L. These radioimmunoconjugates (230 and 460 kBq) showed a significant higher cytotoxicity to SKBR3 human breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2 compared to (111)In-trastuzumab. Microarray analysis revealed that NF-kB-related genes (38 genes) were significantly changed in transcription by (111)In trastuzumab-NLS-L (230 kBq) treatment. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the microarray data by showing transcriptional alternation of selected NF-\u03baB target genes in cells treated with (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS-L. Interestingly, bortezomib, a drug known as a NF-\u03baB modulator, significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS-L in SKBR3 cells. Taken together, the transcriptome data suggest the possibility that the modulation of NF-kB signaling activity is a molecular signature of (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS and coadministration of bortezomib may be efficacious in enhancement of AE-RIT with (111)In-trastuzumab-NLS.", "journal": "Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals", "date": "2015-10-09", "authors": ["Huizi KeikoLi", "YukieMorokoshi", "KazuhiroDaino", "TakakoFurukawa", "TadashiKamada", "TsuneoSaga", "SumitakaHasegawa"], "doi": "10.1089/cbr.2015.1882"}
{"title": "MELK-T1, a small-molecule inhibitor of protein kinase MELK, decreases DNA-damage tolerance in proliferating cancer cells.", "abstract": "Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has oncogenic properties and is overexpressed in many cancer cells. The oncogenic function of MELK is attributed to its capacity to disable critical cell-cycle checkpoints and reduce replication stress. Most functional studies have relied on the use of siRNA/shRNA-mediated gene silencing. In the present study, we have explored the biological function of MELK using MELK-T1, a novel and selective small-molecule inhibitor. Strikingly, MELK-T1 triggered a rapid and proteasome-dependent degradation of the MELK protein. Treatment of MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7) breast adenocarcinoma cells with MELK-T1 induced the accumulation of stalled replication forks and double-strand breaks that culminated in a replicative senescence phenotype. This phenotype correlated with a rapid and long-lasting ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) activation and phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2). Furthermore, MELK-T1 induced a strong phosphorylation of p53 (cellular tumour antigen p53), a prolonged up-regulation of p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1) and a down-regulation of FOXM1 (Forkhead Box M1) target genes. Our data indicate that MELK is a key stimulator of proliferation by its ability to increase the threshold for DNA-damage tolerance (DDT).

Bone is the most frequent site of colonisation and the development of skeletal metastases depends on a complex multistep process, from dissemination and survival of malignant cells into circulation to the actual homing and metastases formation inside bone. Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) can be detected in bone marrow in approximately 30 % of BC patients, likely reflecting the presence of minimal residual disease that would eventually account for subsequent metastatic disease. Patients with bone marrow DTCs have poorer overall survival compared with patients without them. Although bone-only metastatic disease seems to have a rather indolent behavior compared to visceral disease, bone metastases can cause severe and debilitating effects, including pain, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia and pathologic fractures. Delivering an appropriate treatment is therefore paramount and ideally it should require interdisciplinary care.

NZ51, a ring-expanded nucleoside analogue (REN) has been reported to inhibit the ATP dependent helicase activity of DDX3. Molecular modeling of NZ51 binding to DDX3 indicated that the 5:7-fused imidazodiazepine ring of NZ51 was incorporated into the ATP binding pocket of DDX3. In this study, we investigated the anticancer properties of NZ51 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. NZ51 treatment decreased cellular motility and cell viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Biological knockdown of DDX3 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in decreased proliferation rates and reduced clonogenicity. In addition, NZ51 was effective in killing breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions with the same potency as observed during normoxia. Mechanistic studies indicated that NZ51 did not cause DDX3 degradation, but greatly diminished its functionality. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that DDX3 knockdown by shRNA resulted in reduced tumor volume and metastasis without altering tumor vascular volume or permeability-surface area. In initial in vivo experiments, NZ51 treatment did not significantly reduce tumor volume. Further studies are needed to optimize drug formulation, dose and delivery. Continuing work will determine the in vitro-in vivo correlation of NZ51 activity and its utility in a clinical setting.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2015-09-05", "authors": ["MinXie", "FarhadVesuna", "MahendranBotlagunta", "Guus MartinusBol", "AshleyIrving", "YehuditBergman", "Ramachandra SHosmane", "YoshinoriKato", "Paul TWinnard", "VenuRaman"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.4898"}

As predicted based on SIRT6's biological functions, the identified new SIRT6 inhibitors increase histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation, reduce TNF-\u03b1 production and increase glucose uptake in cultured cells.

Current commonly used drugs for adjuvant endocrine therapy can be divided into following three classes: selective estrogen receptor modulators, aromatase inhibitors and selective estrogen receptor downregulators. Tumor cells can develop resistance to endocrine therapy, a major obstacle limiting the success of breast cancer treatment. The complicated crosstalk, both genomic and nongenomic, between estrogen receptors and growth factors was considered to be a crucial factor contributing to endocrine resistance. However, resistance to this therapy is thought to be a progressive, step-wise process, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

Increased expression of this protein promotes tumor growth and metastasis, which can be restricted by ROCK-1 inhibitors. Melatonin has shown oncostatic, antimetastatic, and anti-angiogenic effects and can modulate ROCK-1 expression. Metastatic and nonmetastatic breast cancer cell lines were treated with melatonin as well as with specific ROCK-1 inhibitor (Y27632). Cell viability, cell migration/invasion, and ROCK-1 gene expression and protein expression were determined in\u00a0vitro. In vivo lung metastasis study was performed using female athymic nude mice treated with either melatonin or Y27832 for 2 and 5\u00a0wk. The metastases were evaluated by X-ray computed tomography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and by immunohistochemistry for ROCK-1 and cytokeratin proteins. Melatonin and Y27632 treatments reduced cell viability and invasion/migration of both cell lines and decreased ROCK-1 gene expression in metastatic cells and protein expression in nonmetastatic cell line. The numbers of 'hot' spots (lung metastasis) identified by SPECT images were significantly lower in treated groups. ROCK-1 protein expression also was decreased in metastatic foci of treated groups. Melatonin has shown to be effective in controlling metastatic breast cancer in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, not only via inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells but also through direct antagonism of metastatic mechanism of cells rendered by ROCK-1 inhibition.

In line with previous reports, we found that tumoral CXCR4 expression in patients with locally advanced breast cancer was associated with increased metastases and rapid tumor progression. Moreover, high CXCR4 expression identified a group of bone marrow-disseminated tumor cells (DTC)-negative patients at high risk for metastasis and death. The protein epitope mimetic (PEM) POL5551, a novel CXCR4 antagonist, inhibited binding of SDF-1 to CXCR4, had no direct effects on tumor cell viability, but reduced migration of breast cancer cells in vitro. In two orthotopic models of triple-negative breast cancer, POL5551 had little inhibitory effect on primary tumor growth, but significantly reduced distant metastasis. When combined with eribulin, a chemotherapeutic microtubule inhibitor, POL5551 additively reduced metastasis and prolonged survival in mice after resection of the primary tumor compared with single-agent eribulin. Hypothesizing that POL5551 may mobilize tumor cells from their microenvironment and sensitize them to chemotherapy, we used a \"chemotherapy framing\" dosing strategy. When administered shortly before and after eribulin treatment, three doses of POL5551 with eribulin reduced bone and liver tumor burden more effectively than chemotherapy alone.

The median survival for untreated patients is 1 to 2 months, which may be extended to 6 months with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The outcome of metastasis depends on multiple interactions of unique metastatic cells with host homeostatic mechanisms which the tumor cells exploit for their survival and proliferation. The blood-brain barrier is leaky in metastases that are larger than 0.5-mm diameter because of production of vascular endothelial growth factor by metastatic cells. Brain metastases are surrounded and infiltrated by microglia and activated astrocytes. The interaction with astrocytes leads to up-regulation of multiple genes in the metastatic cells, including several survival genes that are responsible for the increased resistance of tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs.

{"title": "Cyclophosphamide-Mediated Tumor Priming for Enhanced Delivery and Antitumor Activity of HER2-Targeted Liposomal Doxorubicin (MM-302).", "abstract": "Given the bulky nature of nanotherapeutics relative to small molecules, it is hypothesized that effective tumor delivery and penetration are critical barriers to their clinical activity. HER2-targeted PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (MM-302, HER2-tPLD) is an antibody-liposomal drug conjugate designed to deliver doxorubicin to HER2-overexpressing cancer cells while limiting uptake into nontarget cells. In this work, we demonstrate that the administration and appropriate dose sequencing of cyclophosphamide can improve subsequent MM-302 delivery and enhance antitumor activity in preclinical models without negatively affecting nontarget tissues, such as the heart and skin. We demonstrate that this effect is critically dependent on the timing of cyclophosphamide administration. Furthermore, the effect was found to be unique to cyclophosphamide and related analogues, and not shared by other agents, such as taxanes or eribulin, under the conditions examined. Analysis of the cyclophosphamide-treated tumors suggests that the mechanism for improved MM-302 delivery involves the induction of tumor cell apoptosis, reduction of overall tumor cell density, substantial lowering of interstitial fluid pressure, and increasing vascular perfusion. The novel dosing strategy for cyclophosphamide described herein is readily translatable to standard clinical regimens, represents a potentially significant advance in addressing the drug delivery challenge, and may have broad applicability for nanomedicines.

Although TAMs also have high diagnostic and prognostic value, TAM imaging still remains largely unexplored. Here, we describe the development of reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL)-facilitated TAM PET imaging in a breast cancer model.\nRadiolabeled rHDL nanoparticles incorporating the long-lived positron-emitting nuclide (89)Zr were developed using 2 different approaches. The nanoparticles were composed of phospholipids and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in a 2.5:1 weight ratio. (89)Zr was complexed with deferoxamine (also known as desferrioxamine B, desferoxamine B), conjugated either to a phospholipid or to apoA-I to generate (89)Zr-PL-HDL and (89)Zr-AI-HDL, respectively. In vivo evaluation was performed in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer and included pharmacokinetic analysis, biodistribution studies, and PET imaging. Ex vivo histologic analysis of tumor tissues to assess regional distribution of (89)Zr radioactivity was also performed. Fluorescent analogs of the radiolabeled agents were used to determine cell-targeting specificity using flow cytometry.\nThe phospholipid- and apoA-I-labeled rHDL were produced at 79% \u00b1 13% (n = 6) and 94% \u00b1 6% (n = 6) radiochemical yield, respectively, with excellent radiochemical purity (>99%). Intravenous administration of both probes resulted in high tumor radioactivity accumulation (16.5 \u00b1 2.8 and 8.6 \u00b1 1.3 percentage injected dose per gram for apoA-I- and phospholipid-labeled rHDL, respectively) at 24 h after injection. Histologic analysis showed good colocalization of radioactivity with TAM-rich areas in tumor sections.

{"title": "The Therapeutic Challenge of Targeting HER2 in Endometrial Cancer.", "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States, diagnosed in more than 50,000 women annually. While the majority of women present with low-grade tumors that are cured with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, a significant subset of women experience recurrence and do not survive their disease. A disproportionate number of the more than 8,000 annual deaths attributed to endometrial cancer are due to high-grade uterine cancers, highlighting the need for new therapies that target molecular alterations specific to this subset of tumors. Numerous correlative scientific investigations have demonstrated that the HER2 (ERBB2) gene is amplified in 17%-33% of carcinosarcoma, uterine serous carcinoma, and a subset of high-grade endometrioid endometrial tumors. In breast cancer, this potent signature has directed women to anti-HER2-targeted therapies such as trastuzumab and lapatinib. In contrast to breast cancer, therapy with trastuzumab alone revealed no responses in women with recurrent HER2 overexpressing endometrial cancer, suggesting that these tumors may possess acquired or innate trastuzumab resistance mechanisms. This review explores the literature surrounding HER2 expression in endometrial cancer, focusing on trastuzumab and other anti-HER2 therapy and resistance mechanisms characterized in breast cancer but germane to endometrial tumors. Understanding resistance pathways will suggest combination therapies that target both HER2 and key oncogenic escape pathways in endometrial cancer.\nThis review summarizes the role of HER2 in endometrial cancer, with a focus on uterine serous carcinoma. The limitations to date of anti-HER2 therapy in this disease site are examined, and mechanisms of drug resistance are outlined based on the experience in breast cancer. Potential opportunities to overcome inherent resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in endometrial cancer are detailed, offering opportunities for further clinical study with the goal to improve outcomes in this challenging disease.", "journal": "The oncologist", "date": "2015-06-24", "authors": ["Elisabeth JDiver", "RosemaryFoster", "Bo RRueda", "Whitfield BGrowdon"], "doi": "10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0149"}

{"title": "Doxycycline down-regulates DNA-PK and radiosensitizes tumor initiating cells: Implications for more effective radiation therapy.", "abstract": "DNA-PK is an enzyme that is required for proper DNA-repair and is thought to confer radio-resistance in cancer cells. As a consequence, it is a high-profile validated target for new pharmaceutical development. However, no FDA-approved DNA-PK inhibitors have emerged, despite many years of drug discovery and lead optimization. This is largely because existing DNA-PK inhibitors suffer from poor pharmacokinetics. They are not well absorbed and/or are unstable, with a short plasma half-life. Here, we identified the first FDA-approved DNA-PK inhibitor by \"chemical proteomics\". In an effort to understand how doxycycline targets cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), we serendipitously discovered that doxycycline reduces DNA-PK protein expression by nearly 15-fold (> 90%). In accordance with these observations, we show that doxycycline functionally radio-sensitizes breast CSCs, by up to 4.5-fold. Moreover, we demonstrate that DNA-PK is highly over-expressed in both MCF7- and T47D-derived mammospheres. Interestingly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of DNA-PK in MCF7 cells is sufficient to functionally block mammosphere formation. Thus, it appears that active DNA-repair is required for the clonal expansion of CSCs. Mechanistically, doxycycline treatment dramatically reduced the oxidative mitochondrial capacity and the glycolytic activity of cancer cells, consistent with previous studies linking DNA-PK expression to the proper maintenance of mitochondrial DNA integrity and copy number. Using a luciferase-based assay, we observed that doxycycline treatment quantitatively reduces the anti-oxidant response (NRF1/2) and effectively blocks signaling along multiple independent pathways normally associated with stem cells, including STAT1/3, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Notch, WNT and TGF-beta signaling. In conclusion, we propose that the efficacy of doxycycline as a DNA-PK inhibitor should be tested in Phase-II clinical trials, in combination with radio-therapy. Doxycycline has excellent pharmacokinetics, with nearly 100% oral absorption and a long serum half-life (18-22 hours), at a standard dose of 200-mg per day. In further support of this idea, we show that doxycycline effectively inhibits the mammosphere-forming activity of primary breast cancer samples, derived from metastatic disease sites (pleural effusions or ascites fluid). Our results also have possible implications for the radio-therapy of brain tumors and/or brain metastases, as doxycycline is known to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. Further studies will be needed to determine if other tetracycline family members also confer radio-sensitivity.", "journal": "Oncotarget", "date": "2015-06-19", "authors": ["RebeccaLamb", "MarcoFiorillo", "AmyChadwick", "BelaOzsvari", "Kimberly JReeves", "Duncan LSmith", "Robert BClarke", "Sacha JHowell", "Anna RitaCappello", "Ubaldo EMartinez-Outschoorn", "MariaPeiris-Pag\u00e8s", "FedericaSotgia", "Michael PLisanti"], "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.4159"}

{"title": "Elevated ARG1 expression in primary monocytes-derived macrophages as a predictor of radiation-induced acute skin toxicities in early breast cancer patients.", "abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) the front-line treatment after surgery for early breast cancer patients is associated with acute skin toxicities in at least 40% of treated patients. Monocyte-derived macrophages are polarized into functionally distinct (M1 or M2) activated phenotypes at injury sites by specific systemic cytokines known to play a key role in the transition between damage and repair in irradiated tissues. The role of M1 and M2 macrophages in RT-induced acute skin toxicities remains to be defined. We investigated the potential value of M1 and M2 macrophages as predictive factors of RT-induced skin toxicities in early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant RT after lumpectomy. Blood samples collected from patients enrolled in a prospective clinical study (n = 49) were analyzed at baseline and after the first delivered 2Gy RT dose. We designed an ex vivo culture system to differentiate patient blood monocytes into macrophages and treated them with M1 or M2-inducing cytokines before quantitative analysis of their \"M1/M2\" activation markers, iNOS, Arg1, and TGF\u00df1. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate experimental data to clinical assessment of acute skin toxicity using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade for objective evaluation of skin reactions. Increased ARG1 mRNA significantly correlated with higher grades of erythema, moist desquamation, and CTC grade. Multivariate analysis revealed that increased ARG1 expression in macrophages after a single RT dose was an independent prognostic factor of erythema (p = 0 .032), moist desquamation (p = 0 .027), and CTC grade (p = 0 .056). Interestingly, multivariate analysis of ARG1 mRNA expression in macrophages stimulated with IL-4 also revealed independent prognostic value for predicting acute RT-induced toxicity factors, erythema (p = 0 .069), moist desquamation (p = 0 .037), and CTC grade (p = 0 .046).

Recent immunotherapy advances have identified effective interventions to unleash tumor-specific T-cell activity in patients who naturally develop them. Eliciting T-cell responses to a patient's individual tumor remains a major challenge. Radiation therapy can induce immune responses to model antigens expressed by tumors, but it remains unclear whether it can effectively prime T cells specific for endogenous antigens expressed by poorly immunogenic tumors. We hypothesized that TGF\u03b2 activity is a major obstacle hindering the ability of radiation to generate an in situ tumor vaccine. Here, we show that antibody-mediated TGF\u03b2 neutralization during radiation therapy effectively generates CD8(+) T-cell responses to multiple endogenous tumor antigens in poorly immunogenic mouse carcinomas. Generated T cells were effective at causing regression of irradiated tumors and nonirradiated lung metastases or synchronous tumors (abscopal effect).

Upregulation of programmed death (PD) ligand-1 and -2 in neoplastic and myeloid cells and PD-1 on intratumoral T cells limited tumor rejection, resulting in rapid recurrence. Addition of anti-PD-1 antibodies extended survival achieved with radiation and TGF\u03b2 blockade.

Here we elucidate the cellular responses to these agents and identify synthetic lethal interactions with specific DNA repair factors. Toward this end, we first characterized the kinetics of DNA damage by 1 and 3 in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cells. DSBs are rapidly induced by 3, reaching a maximum at 15 min post addition and are resolved within 4 h. By comparison, DSB production by 1 requires 2-4 h to achieve maximal values and >8 h to achieve resolution. As evidenced by an alkaline comet unwinding assay, 3 induces extensive DNA damage, suggesting that the observed DSBs arise from closely spaced single-strand breaks (SSBs). Both 1 and 3 induce ataxia telangiectasia mutated- (ATM-) and DNA-dependent protein kinase- (DNA-PK-) dependent production of phospho-SER139-histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) and generation of p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci in K562 cells within 1 h of exposure, which is indicative of activation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair.

Inasmuch as ZRBA1 downregulates the EGFR TK-mediated antisurvival signaling and induces DNA damage, we postulated that it might be a radiosensitizer. The aim of this study was to further investigate the potentiating effect of ZRBA1 in combination with radiation and to elucidate the possible mechanisms of interaction between these 2 treatment modalities.\nThe triple negative human breast MDA-MB-468 cancer cell line and mouse mammary cancer 4T1 cell line were used in this study. Clonogenic assay, Western blot analysis, and DNA damage analysis were performed at multiple time points after treatment. To confirm our in vitro findings, in vivo tumor growth delay assay was performed.\nOur results show that a combination of ZRBA1 and radiation increases the radiation sensitivity of both cell lines significantly with a dose enhancement factor of 1.56, induces significant numbers of DNA strand breaks, prolongs higher DNA damage up to 24 hours after treatment, and significantly increases tumor growth delay in a syngeneic mouse model.\nOur data suggest that the higher efficacy of this combination could be partially due to increased DNA damage and delayed DNA repair process and to the inhibition of EGFR.

{"title": "Tumor cells switch to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation under radiation via mTOR-mediated hexokinase II inhibition--a Warburg-reversing effect.", "abstract": "A unique feature of cancer cells is to convert glucose into lactate to produce cellular energy, even under the presence of oxygen. Called aerobic glycolysis [The Warburg Effect] it has been extensively studied and the concept of aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells is generally accepted. However, it is not clear if aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells is fixed, or can be reversed, especially under therapeutic stress conditions. Here, we report that mTOR, a critical regulator in cell proliferation, can be relocated to mitochondria, and as a result, enhances oxidative phosphorylation and reduces glycolysis. Three tumor cell lines (breast cancer MCF-7, colon cancer HCT116 and glioblastoma U87) showed a quick relocation of mTOR to mitochondria after irradiation with a single dose 5 Gy, which was companied with decreased lactate production, increased mitochondrial ATP generation and oxygen consumption. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin blocked radiation-induced mTOR mitochondrial relocation and the shift of glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, and reduced the clonogenic survival. In irradiated cells, mTOR formed a complex with Hexokinase II [HK II], a key mitochondrial protein in regulation of glycolysis, causing reduced HK II enzymatic activity. These results support a novel mechanism by which tumor cells can quickly adapt to genotoxic conditions via mTOR-mediated reprogramming of bioenergetics from predominantly aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Such a \"waking-up\" pathway for mitochondrial bioenergetics demonstrates a flexible feature in the energy metabolism of cancer cells, and may be required for additional cellular energy consumption for damage repair and survival. Thus, the reversible cellular energy metabolisms should be considered in blocking tumor metabolism and may be targeted to sensitize them in anti-cancer therapy.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2015-03-26", "authors": ["Chung-LingLu", "LiliQin", "Hsin-ChenLiu", "DemetCandas", "MingFan", "Jian JianLi"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0121046\n10.1126/science.1160809\n10.1038/nrc3038\n10.1007/s00109-014-1174-x\n10.1016/j.ccr.2012.08.014\n10.1016/j.ccr.2013.02.015\n10.1056/NEJMoa1214091\n10.4161/cc.10.24.18487\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.05.017\n10.1038/nrm2672\n10.1073/pnas.0912074106\n10.1016/j.cmet.2013.10.001\n10.1093/neuonc/noq052\n10.1242/jcs.051011\n10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.026\n10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.017\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-3022\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1385\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6604995\n10.1073/pnas.1014769108\n10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-11-0028\n10.1074/jbc.M112.373084\n10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.012\n10.1038/onc.2008.265\n10.1038/ncomms4550\n10.1016/j.molcel.2012.07.002\n10.1016/j.molcel.2012.07.029\n10.1016/j.molcel.2013.12.019\n10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.08.589\n10.1038/onc.2012.567\n10.1038/nrm3025\n10.1371/journal.pone.0012341\n10.1071/RD14474\n10.1016/j.celrep.2014.06.043\n10.1038/nature12122"}

{"title": "[On the prospects of using the DNA repair inhibitors in radiotherapy of tumors].", "abstract": "The cellular DNA repair systems sufficiently provide the resistance of tumors to ionizing radiation, and thus contribute to reducing the effectiveness of their radiotherapy. Therefore, suppression of the activity of critical DNA repair enzymes in tumor cells is considered one of the promising directions to overcome this resistance. As can be seen from the literature analysis, the use of many inhibitors of DNA repair enzymes have not yet yielded the results, which can be extrapolated to preclinical models or clinical trials. However, experimental studies show that the inhibitors of the enzyme family of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are able to inhibit the growth of various human tumor cells. Pre-clinical and clinical trials of the PARP inhibitors also show promising results in terms of the possibility of their wide practical application. The effect of the PARP inhibitors consists in the blockage of the most important DNA repair systems. This leads to the accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks, the collapse of replication forks and to generation of lethal double-strand breaks (DSB). The PARP inhibitors can be used to suppress breast cancer and ovarian cancer with mutations in BRCA-1/2 genes (\"BRCAness\" cancer) without combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In the tumor cells deficient in BRCA-1/2 genes DSB repair by homologous recombination pathway does not function. Therefore, the process of DNA DSB repair is switched to the non-homologous end-joining pathway, which operates with formation of the chromosomal rearrangements leading to cell death. Thus, the analysis results show that DNA repair inhibitors have the potential to improve the efficiency of cancer radiotherapy. Further research in this direction is very promising.", "journal": "Radiatsionnaia biologiia, radioecologiia", "date": "2015-03-15", "authors": ["A IGaziev"], "doi": null}

Although multiple studies have recently revealed the significance of immune cells as mediators of chemotherapy response in breast cancer, less is known regarding roles for leukocytes as mediating outcomes following radiotherapy. To address this question, we utilized a syngeneic orthotopic murine model of mammary carcinogenesis to investigate if response to radiotherapy could be improved when select immune cells or immune-based pathways in the mammary microenvironment were inhibited. Treatment of mammary tumor-bearing mice with either a neutralizing mAb to colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) or a small-molecule inhibitor of the CSF-1 receptor kinase (i.e., PLX3397), resulting in efficient macrophage depletion, significantly delayed tumor regrowth following radiotherapy. Delayed tumor growth in this setting was associated with increased presence of CD8(+) T cells and reduced presence of CD4(+) T cells, the main source of the TH2 cytokine IL4 in mammary tumors. Selective depletion of CD4(+) T cells or neutralization of IL4 in combination with radiotherapy phenocopied results following macrophage depletion, whereas depletion of CD8(+) T cells abrogated improved response to radiotherapy following these therapies. Analogously, therapeutic neutralization of IL4 or IL13, or IL4 receptor alpha deficiency, in combination with the chemotherapy paclitaxel, resulted in slowed primary mammary tumor growth by CD8(+) T-cell-dependent mechanisms.

Osteoblasts obtained from calvarial bones were incubated with irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) and changes in cell viability, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization ability, cell apoptosis and the gene expression levels of ALP, osteocalcin (BGP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and caspase 3 were observed. Notably, ICCM regulated osteoblast function, inhibiting viability and differentiation, resulting in apoptosis or cell death. ICCM at 10 or 20%, from osteoblasts irradiated with 10 Gy \u03b3-rays, significantly inhibited the proliferation of osteoblastic cells (P<0.001). In addition, an increase in apoptosis was noted in the osteoblasts incubated with ICCM at 40% with increasing doses of radiation, accompanied by an upregulation in the mRNA expression of caspase 3. In addition, ICCM at 20% inhibited the ALP activity in the 5 and 10 Gy groups and osteoblast mineralization, particularly at 10 Gy ICCM. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of ALP, BGP, OPG and RANKL of the cells treated with ICCM at 20% were downregulated significantly compared with those treated with medium from unirradiated cells.

With the development of innovative techniques and new molecules as well as new routes of administration, local treatment and adjuvant therapy of early breast cancer have evolved, from mutilating, time-consuming and/or painful procedures to breast-conservative ones, sparing healthy tissues, reducing the total dose of treatment and the treatment time which in turn reduce the occurrence and severity of toxicity. In parallel with these improvements leading to an increase in survival rate, patients' health-related quality of life has become a major concern.

EGFR and AKT are client proteins of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90). Therefore, it was hypothesized that the use of Hsp90 inhibitors might allow the resistance to EGFR-TKIs to be overcome. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibitors are known to function as radiosensitizers in various types of cancer. In the present study, we evaluated the radiosensitizing effect of the novel Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922 (AUY), on NSCLC cell lines harboring EGFR activating mutations and showing acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs via any of several mechanisms. We used HCC827 and PC-9, which are NSCLC cell lines harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions, and gefitinib-resistant sublines derived from the same cell lines with T790M mutation, MET amplification or stem-cell like properties. AUY was more effective against the gefitinib-resistant sublines with T790M mutation and MET amplification than against the parental cell lines, although the subline with stem cell-like properties showed more than a 10-fold higher resistance to AUY than the parental cell line. AUY exerted a significant radiosensitizing effect on the parental cell line and the MET-amplified subline through inducing G2/M arrest and inhibition of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In contrast, the radiosensitizing effect of AUY was limited on the subline with stem cell-like properties, in which it did not induce G2/M arrest or inhibition of NHEJ. In conclusion, combined inhibition of Hsp90 plus radiation was effective, and therefore a promising treatment alternative for overcoming major EGFR-TKI resistance, such as that induced by T790M mutation or MET amplification. However, other approaches are required to overcome minor resistance to EGFR-TKIs, such as that observed in cells with stem cell-like properties.", "journal": "Oncology reports", "date": "2015-01-22", "authors": ["ShinsukeHashida", "HiromasaYamamoto", "KazuhikoShien", "TomoakiOhtsuka", "KenSuzawa", "YuhoMaki", "MasashiFurukawa", "JunichiSoh", "HiroakiAsano", "KazunoriTsukuda", "ShinichiroMiyoshi", "SusumuKanazawa", "ShinichiToyooka"], "doi": "10.3892/or.2015.3735"}

However, additional preclinical studies are needed to demonstrate the antigen-specific nature of radiation-induced immune responses and elucidate potential mechanisms of synergy with immunotherapy. Here, we demonstrate the ability of stereotactic XRT to induce endogenous antigen-specific immune responses when it is combined with anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Using the small animal radiation research platform (SARRP), image-guided stereotactic XRT delivered to B16-OVA melanoma or 4T1-HA breast carcinoma tumors resulted in the development of antigen-specific T cell- and B cell-mediated immune responses. These immune-stimulating effects of XRT were significantly increased when XRT was combined with either anti-PD-1 therapy or regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion, resulting in improved local tumor control. Phenotypic analyses of antigen-specific CD8 T cells revealed that XRT increased the percentage of antigen-experienced T cells and effector memory T cells. Mechanistically, we found that XRT upregulates tumor-associated antigen-MHC complexes, enhances antigen cross-presentation in the draining lymph node, and increases T-cell infiltration into tumors. These findings demonstrate the ability of XRT to prime an endogenous antigen-specific immune response and provide an additional mechanistic rationale for combining radiation with PD-1 blockade in the clinic.", "journal": "Cancer immunology research", "date": "2014-12-21", "authors": ["Andrew BSharabi", "Christopher JNirschl", "Christina MKochel", "Thomas RNirschl", "Brian JFrancica", "EstebanVelarde", "Theodore LDeweese", "Charles GDrake"], "doi": "10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-14-0196"}

Using our mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer promoted by loss of LKB1 expression in an ErbB2 activated model; referred to as LKB1-/-NIC mice, we evaluated the effect of novel therapies in vivo on primary tumors. Treatment of LKB1-/-NIC mice with AZD8055 and 2-DG mono-therapies significantly reduced mammary gland tumorigenesis by inhibiting mTOR pathways and glycolytic metabolism; however simultaneous inhibition of these pathways with AZD8055/2-DG combination was significantly more effective at reducing tumor volume and burden.

We have previously shown that Bcl-2 overexpression was associated with an increased risk of local recurrence in patients with early stage breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore an approach to overcome radiation resistance by targeting pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins in breast cancer cells. The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB231 were used in this study. siRNAs were employed to silence myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). A small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, ABT-737, was used to target anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Apoptosis was identified by FITC Annexin V, PI staining and Western blot analysis. The sensitivity to ionizing radiation and ABT-737 were measured by clonogenic assays. The effect of radiation and ABT-737 was also tested in a MCF-7 xenograft mouse model. Our data demonstrate that the combination of ABT-737 and radiation-induced apoptosis had an inhibitory effect on breast cancer cell proliferation. However, treatment with ABT-737 resulted in elevated Mcl-1 in breast cancer cell lines. Targeting Mcl-1 by siRNA sensitized MCF-7 cells to ABT-737. We revealed that radiation blunted Mcl-1 elevation induced by ABT-737, and that radiation downregulated Mcl-1 by promoting its degradation. Our results indicate that radiation and ABT-737 exert a synergistic effect on breast cancer cell lines through downregulating Mcl-1 and activating the bak-apoptotic pathway.

{"title": "Invariant natural killer T cells regulate anti-tumor immunity by controlling the population of dendritic cells in tumor and draining lymph nodes.", "abstract": "Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are CD1d-restricted T cells, which respond rapidly to antigen recognition and promote development of anti-tumor immunity in many tumor models. Surprisingly, we previously found that mice deficient in iNKT cells developed spontaneous CD8(+) T cells responses partially effective at inhibiting metastases in mice bearing the 4T1 mammary carcinoma, and showed a markedly improved response to treatment with local radiotherapy and anti-CTLA-4 antibody compared to wild type (WT) mice.\nTo understand the mechanisms of the immunosuppressive function of iNKT cells, dendritic cells (DCs) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry in WT and iNKT-deficient (iNKT(-/-)) mice. The effects of antibody-mediated blockade of CD1d on DC number and phenotype, priming of anti-tumor T cells, and tumor response to treatment with local radiotherapy and anti-CTLA-4 antibody were evaluated. To determine if the improved response to treatment in the absence of iNKT cells was independent from the immunotherapy employed, 4T1-tumor bearing WT and iNKT(-/-) mice were treated with local radiotherapy in combination with antibody-mediated CD137 co-stimulation.\nDCs in 4T1 tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes but not distant lymph nodes were significantly reduced in WT mice compared to iNKT(-/-) mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05), suggesting the selective elimination of DCs cross-presenting tumor-associated antigens by iNKT cells. Consistently, priming of T cells to a tumor-specific CD8 T cell epitope in mice treated with radiotherapy and anti-CTLA-4 or anti-CD137 was markedly enhanced in iNKT(-/-) compared to WT mice. CD1d blockade restored the number of DC in WT mice, improved T cell priming in draining lymph nodes and significantly enhanced response to treatment.\nHere we describe a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape mediated by iNKT cells that limit priming of anti-tumor T cells by controlling DC in tumors and draining lymph nodes.

In particular, numerous studies have reported a positive relationship between high bone mineral density (BMD) and a greater risk of breast cancer. On the other hand, most treatments in early breast cancer women including ovarian suppression treatments (chemotherapy, surgery or GnRH agonists) and aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy induce a profound and rapid suppression of estrogen levels thereby increasing the rate of bone loss.

Here, the CatK inhibitor L-235 dosed in prevention (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d.) or treatment regimen (30 mg/kg) was compared with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL, 7.5 \u03bcg/kg/wk, s.c.) in the intratibial injection model of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma in nude rats. Progression of osteolysis, skeletal tumor burden, and local metastasis was evaluated by radiography through 42 days and ex vivo \u03bcCT and histology. IHC and RT-PCR confirmed the increases in CatK protein and mRNA levels in human breast cancer primary and metastatic tumors. In the experimental model of breast cancer bone metastasis, L-235 dosed in preventive mode resulted in a dose-related reduction of osteolysis of 72%, 75%, and 87% respectively, compared with ZOL by 86% versus intact.

Efficacy of L-235 and ZOL on reduction of osteolytic lesions and tumor burden was comparable in treatment versus preventive regimens. All L-235 doses inhibited cortical disruption and extraskeletal tumor growth to a level comparable with ZOL.

Furthermore, co-targeting was able to block the formation of acquired resistance in H3122 line.

A further understanding of the mechanisms of radioresistance could provide strategies to address this challenge. In our study, we compared the expression of miR-200c in four distinct breast cancer cell lines: two representative basal cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT549) vs. two representative luminal cancer cells (MCF-7 and BT474). The results revealed practically lower expression of miR-200c in the two basal cancer cell lines and higher expression of miR-200c in luminal cancer cells compared to the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Ectopic expression of miR-200c in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited irradiation-induced autophagy and sensitized the breast cancer cells to irradiation. We also identified UBQLN1 as a direct functional target of miR-200c involved in irradiation-induced autophagy and radioresistance. In 35 human breast cancer tissue samples, we detected an inverse correlation between the expression of miR-200c vs. UBQLN1 and LC3.

However, Pgp expression detected at the mRNA or protein level does not always correlate with functional transport activity. Because Pgp transport activity is affected by specific mutations and the phosphorylation state of the protein, altered or less active forms of Pgp may also be detected by PCR or immunohistochemistry, which do not accurately reflect the status of tumor cell resistance. To interrogate the status of the functional expression of MDR1 Pgp in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, cellular transport studies using Tc-Sestamibi were performed and correlated with western blot analysis. Biochemical transport assays in human pancreatic carcinoma MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, human epidermal carcinoma drug-sensitive KB-3-1 cells, and human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells (negative controls), and human epidermal carcinoma drug-resistant KB-8-5 cells, human breast carcinoma stably transfected with Pgp MCF-7/MDR1Pgp cells, and liver carcinoma HepG2 cells (positive controls) were performed. Protein levels were determined using a monoclonal antibody C219. Tc-Sestamibi demonstrates accumulation in human pancreatic carcinoma MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Uptake profiles are not affected by treatment with LY335979, a Pgp inhibitor, and correlate with western blot analysis. These cellular transport studies indicate an absence of Pgp at a functional level in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Because major pancreatic tumors originate from the pancreatic duct and Tc-Sestamibi undergoes a dominant hepatobiliary mode of excretion, it would not be a sensitive probe for imaging pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

Retrospective and prospective studies suggest that there is substantial discordance in receptor status between primary and recurrent breast cancer. Despite this evidence and current recommendations,the acquisition of tissue from metastatic deposits is not routine practice. As a consequence, therapeutic decisions for treatment in the metastatic setting are based on the features of the primary tumor. Reasons for this attitude include the invasiveness of the procedure and the unreliable outcome of biopsy, in particular for biopsies of lesions at complex visceral sites. Improvements in interventional radiology techniques mean that most metastatic sites are now accessible by minimally invasive methods, including surgery. In our opinion, since biopsies are diagnostic and changes in biological features between the primary and secondary tumors can occur, the routine biopsy of metastatic disease needs to be performed. In this review, we discuss the rationale for biopsy of suspected breast cancer metastases, review issues and caveats surrounding discordance of biomarker status between primary and metastatic tumors, and provide insights for deciding when to perform biopsy of suspected metastases and which one (s) to biopsy. We also speculate on the future translational implications for biopsy of suspected metastatic lesions in the context of clinical trials and the establishment of bio-banks of biopsy material taken from metastatic sites.

The most effective ChoK inhibitors are symmetric and contain quaternary ammonium groups within heterocyclic head groups connected by an aliphatic spacer. Characterization of these bis-pyridinium and bis-quinolinium compounds has led to phase I clinical trials to assess small-molecule inhibitors of ChoK for solid tumor treatment. We report the development of a novel carbocyanine dye, JAS239, whose bis-indolium structure conforms to the parameters established for ChoK specificity and whose spacer length confers fluorescence in the near-infrared (NIR) window. Fluorimetry and confocal microscopy were used to demonstrate that JAS239 rapidly enters breast cancer cells independent of the choline transporters, with accumulation in the cytosolic space where ChoK is active. Radio-tracing and (1)H MRS techniques were used to determine that JAS239 binds and competitively inhibits ChoK intracellularly, preventing choline phosphorylation while inducing cell death in breast cancer cell lines with similar efficacy to known ChoK inhibitors. Fluorescent molecules that report on ChoK status have potential use as companion diagnostics for noninvasive breast tumor staging, because NIR fluorescence allows for detection of real-time probe accumulation in vivo.

{"title": "Combined SFK/mTOR inhibition prevents rapamycin-induced feedback activation of AKT and elicits efficient tumor regression.", "abstract": "Resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) blockade in breast cancer is often mediated by activation of bypass pathways that sustain growth. Src and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are two intrinsic targets that are downstream of most RTKs. To date, limited clinical efficacy has been observed with either Src or mTOR inhibitors when used as single agents. Resistance to mTOR inhibitors is associated with loss of negative feedback regulation, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of AKT. Herein, we describe a novel role for Src in contributing to rapalog-induced AKT activation. We found that dual activation of Src and the mTOR pathway occurs in nearly half of all breast cancers, suggesting potential cross-talk. As expected, rapamycin inhibition of mTOR results in feedback activation of AKT in breast cancer cell lines. Addition of the Src/c-Abl inhibitor, dasatinib, completely blocks this feedback activation, confirming convergence between Src and the mTOR pathway. Analysis in vivo revealed that dual Src and mTOR inhibition is highly effective in two mouse models of breast cancer. In a luminal disease model, combined dasatinib and rapamycin is more effective at inducing regression than either single agent. Furthermore, the combination of dasatinib and rapamycin delays tumor recurrence following the cessation of treatment. In a model of human EGFR-2-positive (HER2(+)) disease, dasatinib alone is ineffective, but potentiates the efficacy of rapamycin. These data suggest that combining mTOR and Src inhibitors may provide a new approach for treating multiple breast cancer subtypes that may circumvent resistance to targeted RTK therapies.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2014-07-16", "authors": ["Jennifer LYori", "Kristen LLozada", "Darcie DSeachrist", "Jonathan DMosley", "Fadi WAbdul-Karim", "Christine NBooth", "Chris AFlask", "Ruth AKeri"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3627"}

Fibroids do not increase the risk of malignant uterine disease and leiomyosarcomas are extremely rare (less than one in 1000). It is unknown at present whether leiomyosarcoma represents de novo growth or malignant transformation from benign uterine fibroids. Treatment options for symptomatic fibroids include pharmacologic, surgical and radiologically guided interventions. The range of medical treatments allows flexible management of fibroid-related symptoms; the options include tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, contraceptive steroids, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, antiprogesterone, and selective progesterone receptor modulators. However, these medical options do not remove the tumors and symptoms may return when treatment is stopped.

This review considers first current treatment options: surgery; radiotherapy; and systemic endocrine, anti-biological, and cytotoxic therapies. Clinical management includes prevention, early detection by screening, treatment with curative intent, management of chronic disease, and palliative control of advanced breast cancer. Next, the potential of novel drugs that target DNA repair, growth factor dependence, intracellular and intercellular signal transduction, and cell cycle are considered. Estrogen-related receptor alpha has attracted attention as a therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancers with de novo resistance to, and in breast cancers with acquired resistance to, endocrine therapies such as antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors. Estrogen-related receptor alpha is an orphan receptor and transcription factor. Its activity is regulated by coregulator proteins and posttranslational modification. It is an energy sensor that controls adaptation to energy demand and may facilitate glycolytic metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative respiration in breast cancer cells. Estrogen-related receptor alpha increases breast cancer cell migration, proliferation, and tumor development. It is expressed at high levels in estrogen receptor-negative tumors, and is proposed to activate estrogen-responsive genes in endocrine-resistant tumors. The structures and functions of the ligand-binding domains of estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen-related receptor alpha, their ability to bind estrogens, phytoestrogens, and synthetic ligands, and the effects of ligand agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists on biological activity, are evaluated. Synthetic ligands of estrogen-related receptor alpha have activity in preclinical models of metabolic disorders, diabetes, osteoporosis, and oncology.

Patients were evaluated using CT before and after at least 6 months of AI therapy with imaging follow-up of 4.3 \u00b1 2.2 years. Abdominal fat distribution was automatically calculated using a workstation that obtained total abdominal adipose tissue (TAAT) area (mm(3)). SAT was manually segmented and VAT was determined as TAAT - SAT. Percentages were calculated for change of TAAT, VAT, and SAT. VAT/SAT ratio was calculated.\nPercentage of TAAT after AI therapy was increased by a mean of 9.1% from baseline (16,280.3 \u00b1 6953.3 mm(3)) to (17,763.6 \u00b1 6850.8 mm(3)). Two groups of patients were observed; those with an increase in TAAT and those with a decrease. Modification of VAT/SAT ratio was observed (from 1.38 to 1.69) in all subjects, reflecting a relative increased volume of VAT (mean, 18%) and slight mean reduction of SAT (mean 1.9%).\nIn our study, therapy with AI in breast cancer patients was accompanied with a change in fat distribution to relatively greater VAT/SAT ratio in patients, regardless of whether they gained or lost weight after therapy. Because this pattern of fat distribution is associated with metabolic disorders, attention must be paid to these clinical manifestations in patients during their follow-up management.", "journal": "Clinical breast cancer", "date": "2014-05-23", "authors": ["SofiaBattisti", "Francesco MariaGuida", "FedericaCoppa", "Donata MVaccaro", "DanieleSantini", "GiuseppeTonini", "Bruno BZobel", "Richard CSemelka"], "doi": "10.1016/j.clbc.2014.02.003"}
{"title": "Identification of a radiation sensitivity gene expression profile in primary fibroblasts derived from patients who developed radiotherapy-induced fibrosis.", "abstract": "During radiotherapy, normal tissue is unavoidably exposed to radiation which results in severe normal tissue reactions in a small fraction of patients. Because those who are sensitive cannot be determined prior to radiotherapy, the doses are limited to all patients to avoid an unacceptable number of severe adverse normal tissue responses. This limitation restricts the optimal treatment for individuals who are more tolerant to radiation. Genetic variation is a likely source for the normal tissue radiosensitivity variation observed between individuals. Therefore, understanding the radiation response at the genomic level may provide knowledge to develop individualized treatment and improve radiotherapy outcomes.\nExon arrays were utilized to compare the basal expression profile between cell lines derived from six cancer patients with and without severe fibrosis. These data were supported by qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq techniques.\nA set of genes (FBN2, FST, GPRC5B, NOTCH3, PLCB1, DPT, DDIT4L and SGCG) were identified as potential predictors for radiation-induced fibrosis. Many of these genes are associated with TGF\u03b2 or retinoic acid both having known links to fibrosis.\nA combinatorial gene expression approach provides a promising strategy to predict fibrosis in cancer patients prior to radiotherapy.", "journal": "Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology", "date": "2014-05-20", "authors": ["Helen BForrester", "JasonLi", "TrevorLeong", "Michael JMcKay", "Carl NSprung"], "doi": "10.1016/j.radonc.2014.03.007"}

We have previously reported that loss of grip strength is more pronounced in AI-users with extremes in BMI. We here report results from a larger prospective study. Postmenopausal early breast cancer patients scheduled to start AI or tamoxifen therapy were recruited. A functional assessment grip strength test was performed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months of therapy. BMI was assessed, and a rheumatologic questionnaire was completed at each visit. 188 patients on an AI and 104 patients on tamoxifen were enrolled. 74\u00a0% of AI-users reported new/worsened musculoskeletal complaints compared with 37\u00a0% in the tamoxifen group. This was translated in a larger grip strength decrease in patients experiencing AI-induced pain opposed to patients without new/worsened complaints (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002). 15\u00a0% of AI-users discontinued therapy due to musculoskeletal symptoms, who were characterized by a larger grip strength reduction versus adherent patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0107).

{"title": "Regulation of ionizing radiation-induced adhesion of breast cancer cells to fibronectin by alpha5beta1 integrin.", "abstract": "Ionizing radiation (IR) is commonly used for cancer therapy, however, its potential influence on cancer metastatic potential remains controversial. In this study, we elucidated the role of integrins in regulation of IR-altered adhesion between breast cancer cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which is a key step in the initial phase of metastasis. Our data suggest that the extent of effect that ionizing radiation had on cell adhesion depended on the genetic background of the breast cancer cells. Ionizing radiation was a better adhesion inducer for p53-mutated cells, such as MDA-MB-231 cells, than for p53 wild-type cells, such as MCF-7 cells. While IR-induced adhesions between MDA-MB-231 cells to fibronectin, laminin, collagen I and collagen IV, only blocking of the adhesion between \u03b15\u03b21 integrin and fibronectin using anti-\u03b15\u03b21 integrin antibody could completely inhibit the radiation-induced adhesion of the cells. A soluble Arg-Gly-Asp peptide, the binding motif for fibronectin binding integrins, could also reduce the adhesion of the cells to fibronectin with or without ionizing radiation exposure. The inhibition of the cell-fibronectin interaction also affected, but did not always correlate with, transwell migration of the cancer cells. In addition, our data showed that the total expression of \u03b15 integrin and surface expression of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin were increased in the cells treated with ionizing radiation. The increased surface expression of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, along with the adhesion between the cells and fibronectin, could be inhibited by both ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase inhibitors. These results suggested that ATM/ATR-mediated surface expression of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin might play a central role in regulation of ionizing radiation-altered adhesion.", "journal": "Radiation research", "date": "2014-05-03", "authors": ["Shin HeeLee", "HuiwenCheng", "YeYuan", "ShiyongWu"], "doi": "10.1667/RR13543.1"}

This method allows axilla-conserving surgery in patients responding well to NST.\nPrior to NST, proven tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes were marked with a I seed. This marked lymph node is the so-called MARI-node. After NST, the MARI node was selectively removed using a \u03b3-detection probe. A complementary axillary lymph node dissection was performed in all patients to assess whether pathological response in the MARI node was indicative for the pathological response in the additional lymph nodes.\nA tumor-positive axillary lymph node was marked with a I seed in 100 patients. The MARI node was successfully identified in 97 of these 100 patients (identification rate 97%). Two patients did not undergo subsequent axillary lymph node dissection, leaving 95 patients for further analysis. The MARI node contained residual tumor cells in 65 of these 95 patients. In the other 30 patients, the MARI node was free of tumor, but additional positive lymph nodes were found in 5 patients. Thus, the MARI procedure correctly identified 65 of 70 patients with residual axillary tumor activity (false negative rate 5/70 = 7%).\nThis study shows that marking and selectively removing metastatic lymph nodes after neoadjuvant systemic treatment has a high identification rate and a low false negative rate.

Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), an antiulcer agent used in Japan for 30 years, has no significant adverse effects, and unexpectedly reduces ovarian cancer progression in mice. Because GGA reduces oxidative stress in brain and heart, we hypothesized that GGA would prevent oxidative stress of doxorubicin cardiac toxicity and improve doxorubicin's chemotherapeutic effects. Nude mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were studied after chronic treatment with doxorubicin, doxorubicin/GGA, GGA, or saline. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to monitor systolic heart function and xenografts evaluated. Mice were euthanized and cardiac tissue evaluated for reactive oxygen species generation, TUNEL assay, and RHO/ROCK pathway analysis. Tumor metastases were evaluated in lung sections. In vitro studies using Boyden chambers were performed to evaluate GGA effects on RHO pathway activator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced motility and invasion. We found that GGA reduced doxorubicin cardiac toxicity, preserved cardiac function, prevented TUNEL-positive cardiac cell death, and reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidant production in a nitric oxide synthase-dependent and independent manner. GGA also reduced heart doxorubicin-induced ROCK1 cleavage. Remarkably, in xenograft-implanted mice, combined GGA/doxorubicin treatment decreased tumor growth more effectively than doxorubicin treatment alone. As evidence of antitumor effect, GGA inhibited LPA-induced motility and invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells. These anti-invasive effects of GGA were suppressed by geranylgeraniol suggesting GGA inhibits RHO pathway through blocking geranylation. Thus, GGA protects the heart from doxorubicin chemotherapy-induced injury and improves anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin in breast cancer.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2014-04-17", "authors": ["PolinaSysa-Shah", "YiXu", "XinGuo", "ScottPin", "DjahidaBedja", "RachelBartock", "AllisonTsao", "AngelaHsieh", "Michael SWolin", "AnMoens", "VenuRaman", "HajimeOrita", "Kathleen LGabrielson"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0965"}

Accordingly, metabolic readouts can serve as biomarkers of response to therapy. The goal of this study was to investigate some of the MRS-detectable metabolic consequences of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition. We investigated PC3 prostate cancer, MCF-7 breast cancer and A375 melanoma cells, and determined that, consistent with previous studies, MRS-detectable levels of phosphocholine decreased significantly in all cell lines (to 63%, 50% and 18% of the control, respectively) following MEK inhibition with U0126. This effect was mediated by a decrease in the expression of choline kinase \u03b1, the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline. In contrast, the impact of MEK inhibition on glycolysis was cell line dependent. A375 cells, which express mutant BRAF, demonstrated significant decreases in glucose uptake (to 36% of control) and lactate production (to 42% of control) in line with positron emission tomography data. In contrast, in PC3 and MCF-7 cells, increases in glucose uptake (to 198% and 192% of control, respectively) and lactate production (to 177% and 212% of control, respectively) were observed, in line with a previous hyperpolarized (13) C MRS study. This effect is probably mediated by the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and AMP-activated protein kinase.

Phosphoprotein antibody array analysis revealed that PL does not modulate kinases known to activate Stat3 such as Janus kinases, Src kinase family members\u00a0or receptor tyrosine kinases. PL inhibited anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent growth of multiple breast cancer cell lines having increased pStat3 or total Stat3, and induced apoptosis. PL also inhibited mammosphere formation by tumor cells from patient-derived xenografts. PL's antitumorigenic function was causally linked to its Stat3-inhibitory effect. PL was non-toxic in mice up to a dose of 30\u2009mg/kg/day for 14 days and caused regression of breast cancer cell line xenografts in nude mice.

Using small molecule inhibitors, the relationship between DSB repair and radiation-induced apoptosis was examined. Sixteen breast cancer patients with minimal (controls, n = 8) or extremely marked late radiation-induced change (cases, n = 8) and eight healthy volunteers were selected. DSBs were quantified by \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 immunofluorescence, and apoptosis was measured using a fluorogenic inhibitor of caspases assay. Mean \u03b3H2AX/53BP1 focus levels 24 h after exposure to 4 Gy were higher in cases (12.7 foci per cell) than in controls (10.3 foci per cell, p = 0.002). In contrast, the mean apoptotic fraction 48 h after 8 Gy was comparable, 37.2 % in cases and 34.7 % in controls (p = 0.442). Residual focus and apoptosis levels were not correlated within individuals (Spearman's R = -0.0059, p = 0.785). However, cells treated with DNA-PK inhibitor Nu7441 had higher focus and apoptosis levels 48 h after 1 Gy compared to mock-treated cells, suggesting that apoptosis induction following irradiation is modulated by DSB repair. This effect required functional ATM since cells treated simultaneously with Nu7441 and the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 were resistant to apoptosis despite high levels of residual foci. One clinical case displayed an impaired DNA-PK-dependent end-joining cellular phenotype. In summary, clinical radiosensitivity may be associated with impaired DSB repair in some patients.

Lysophosphatidate promotes cancer cell survival, growth, migration, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The present work investigated whether inhibiting autotaxin could decrease breast tumor growth and metastasis. We used a new autotaxin inhibitor (ONO-8430506; IC90=100 nM), which decreased plasma autotaxin activity by >60% and concentrations of unsaturated lysophosphatidates by >75% for 24 h compared with vehicle-treated mice. The effects of ONO-8430506 on tumor growth were determined in a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer following injection of 20,000 BALB/c mouse 4T1 or 4T1-12B cancer cells. We show for the first time that inhibiting autotaxin decreases initial tumor growth and subsequent lung metastatic nodules both by 60% compared with vehicle-treated mice. Significantly, 4T1 cells express negligible autotaxin compared with the mammary fat pad. Autotaxin activity in the fat pad of nontreated mice was increased 2-fold by tumor growth. Our results emphasize the importance of tumor interaction with its environment and the role of autotaxin in promoting breast cancer growth and metastasis.

As a result, SSRIinduced akathisia is very frequently under-recognized. A review of literature showed that almost all frequently used SSRIs such as Fluvoxamine, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram have been reported to be causing akathisia. SSRI-induced restless legs syndrome and movement disorders have also been reported. However, Escitalopram-induced akathisia is rare. In our review of literature, we could find only one single case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia. And this specific SSRI drug has rarely been implicated with occurrence of restless legs syndrome and extra-pyramidal side-effects like dytonia etc. Here, we present a case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia - a 53year old female, who had developed severe akathisia after taking Escitalopram for a few days. According to the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), her Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia Score was 5 i.e. severe akathisia. As per Naronjo Adverse Drug Reaction Scale the probability of association of this adverse reaction with Escitalopram was 7 (i.e. probable). Her symptoms continued in spite of prompt discontinuation of the drug. But, she improved rapidly with the use of Propranolol and Clonazepam. On the last follow-up, she was free from any symptoms. As new generation antidepressants are rarely associated with extra-pyramidal symptoms, the recognition of such adverse effects requires a high index of suspicion.

To elucidate further the mechanism of separase function and to test if inhibition of overexpressed separase can be used as a strategy to inhibit tumor-cell proliferation, small-molecule inhibitors of separase enzyme are essential. Here, we report a high-throughput screening for separase inhibitors (Sepins). We developed a fluorogenic separase assay using rhodamine 110-conjugated Rad21 peptide as substrate and screened a small-molecule compound library. We identified a noncompetitive inhibitor of separase called Sepin-1 that inhibits separase enzymatic activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 14.8 \u00b5M.

Informed consent was obtained from all participants. All patients underwent breast MR imaging before starting any medication, under tamoxifen, and after switching to an AI. Qualitative and quantitative degrees of benign parenchymal enhancement were investigated before treatment, under tamoxifen, and under AI. Data were analyzed by using the Wilcoxon singed-rank test and Student t test for matched pairs.\nBefore treatment, the distribution of background enhancement MR-American College of Radiology (ACR) categories 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 20%, 35%, 33%, and 13%, respectively. With tamoxifen, background enhancement was suppressed, with a distribution of 80%, 15%, 5%, and 0% for MR-ACR categories 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

Although both drugs improve progression-free survival, many patients' tumours will exhibit primary resistance, or develop secondary resistance, to anti-HER-2 therapies.

Radical prostatectomy continues to be the most frequently performed treatment for localized PCa, as anatomic knowledge and several technical advances, i.e. the introduction of robotic assisted surgery, have led to successful oncological outcome and lower rates of post-treatment morbidity. However, a proportion of patients still experiences a no negligible sexual, urinary, and bowel morbidity. Although the rationale of active surveillance for low-risk PCa (PSA <10 ng/mL, Gleason grade 6 or less, and clinical stage T1c-T2a) is sound, only few of newly diagnosed patients elect this approach.

This high risk is associated with the presence of multiple pre-malignant cell clones in the contralateral breast at the time of primary breast cancer diagnosis. Mechanistic analyses suggest that a moderate dose of X-rays to the contralateral breast can kill these pre-malignant clones such that, at an appropriate Prophylactic Mammary Irradiation (PMI) dose, the long-term contralateral breast cancer risk in breast cancer survivors would be considerably decreased.\nTo test the predicted relationship between PMI dose and cancer risk in mammary glands that have a high risk of developing malignancies.\nWe tested the PMI concept using MMTV-PyVT mammary-tumor-prone mice. Mammary glands on one side of each mouse were irradiated with X-rays, while those on the other side were shielded from radiation. The unshielded mammary glands received doses of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 Gy in 4-Gy fractions.\nIn high-risk mammary glands exposed to radiation doses designed for PMI (12 and 16 Gy), tumor incidence rates were respectively decreased by a factor of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1-5.0) at 12 Gy, and a factor of 3.1 (95% CI, 1.3-8.3) at 16 Gy, compared to those in the shielded glands that were exposed to very low radiation doses. The same pattern was seen for PMI-exposed mammary glands relative to zero-dose controls.\nThe pattern of cancer risk reduction by PMI was consistent with mechanistic predictions. Contralateral breast PMI may thus have promise as a spatially targeted breast-conserving option for reducing the current high risk of contralateral second breast cancers.

The 2D Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) algorithm was adapted to distribute catheters uniformly in space, within the maximum external contour of the planning target volume. The catheters optimization procedure includes the inverse planning simulated annealing algorithm (IPSA). Complete treatment plans can then be generated from the algorithm for different number of catheters. The best plan is chosen from different dosimetry criteria and will automatically provide the number of catheters and their positions. After the CVT algorithm parameters were optimized for speed and dosimetric results, it was validated against prostate clinical cases, using clinically relevant dose parameters. The robustness to implantation error was also evaluated. Finally, the efficiency of the method was tested in breast interstitial HDR brachytherapy cases.\nThe effect of the number and locations of the catheters on prostate cancer patients was studied. Treatment plans with a better or equivalent dose distributions could be obtained with fewer catheters. A better or equal prostate V100 was obtained down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of prostate V100 and D90. Implantation errors up to 3 mm were acceptable since no statistical difference was found when compared to 0 mm error (p > 0.05). No significant difference in dosimetric indices was observed for the different combination of parameters within the CVT algorithm. A linear relation was found between the number of random points and the optimization time of the CVT algorithm. Because the computation time decrease with the number of points and that no effects were observed on the dosimetric indices when varying the number of sampling points and the number of iterations, they were respectively fixed to 2500 and to 100. The computation time to obtain ten complete treatments plans ranging from 9 to 18 catheters, with the corresponding dosimetric indices, was 90 s. However, 93% of the computation time is used by a research version of IPSA. For the breast, on average, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recommendations would be satisfied down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of V100, dose homogeneity index, and D90.\nThe authors have devised a simple, fast and efficient method to optimize the number and position of catheters in interstitial HDR brachytherapy. The method was shown to be robust for both prostate and breast HDR brachytherapy. More importantly, the computation time of the algorithm is acceptable for clinical use.

{"title": "When and how do I use neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer?", "abstract": "Systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy is utilized along with surgery and radiotherapy for the management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The backbone of current chemotherapy regimens include anthracyclines and taxanes given either sequentially or concurrently for up to 8 cycles. Neoadjuvant treatment benefits include in vivo assessment of response to treatment with reduction in the extent of primary and regional metastases. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable breast cancer is used in women who desire breast conservation surgery who are not candidates for such treatment at the time of the diagnosis. The use of neoadjuvant treatment in patients, who present with operable breast cancer, shows equivalent survival outcome compared with adjuvant breast cancer treatment. Several prospective studies have evaluated the role of trastuzumab in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with Her2-positive disease. The addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improvement of the complete clinical and pathological complete response to therapy and significantly improved event-free survival and overall survival. Dual Her2 blockade is emerging as a new approach to improve pathological complete response rates and therefore survival. To date, in triple-negative breast cancer, there are no predictive markers to identify potential treatment targets. Triple-negative patients who achieve a pathological complete response have more favorable outcome compared with those with residual disease following neoadjuvant treatment. The choice of optimal chemotherapy regimen and the duration of treatment have been studied extensively in the neoadjuvant setting. No consensus has been developed thus far. Following work done with anthracycline and CMF treatments in neoadjuvant chemotherapy, recent studies in locally advanced breast cancer focus on the addition of new and target agents. All of these trials are based on well-established regimes used in the adjuvant setting. Successful use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy requires a coordinated multidisciplinary approach.", "journal": "Current treatment options in oncology", "date": "2013-12-07", "authors": ["Bernardo LRapoport", "Georgia SDemetriou", "Shun DMoodley", "Carol ABenn"], "doi": "10.1007/s11864-013-0266-0"}
{"title": "Combination of the c-Met inhibitor tivantinib and zoledronic acid prevents tumor bone engraftment and inhibits progression of established bone metastases in a breast xenograft model.", "abstract": "Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer. There is a significant need to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling the engraftment and growth of tumor cells in bone and to discover novel effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of tivantinib and Zoledronic Acid (ZA) in combination in a breast xenograft model of bone metastases. Cancer cells were intracardially implanted into immunodeficient mice and the effects of drugs alone or in combination on bone metastasis were evaluated by in vivo non-invasive optical and micro-CT imaging technologies. Drugs were administered either before (preventive regimen) or after (therapeutic regimen) bone metastases were detectable. In the preventive regimen, the combination of tivantinib plus ZA was much more effective than single agents in delaying bone metastatic tumor growth. When administered in the therapeutic schedule, the combination delayed metastatic progression and was effective in improving survival. These effects were not ascribed to a direct cytotoxic effect of the combined therapy on breast cancer cells in vitro. The results of this study provide the rationale for the design of new combinatorial strategies with tivantinib and ZA for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-11-22", "authors": ["SaraPrevidi", "FedericaScolari", "RosariaChil\u00e0", "FrancescaRicci", "GiovanniAbbadessa", "MassimoBroggini"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0079101"}
{"title": "Combined antiproliferative effects of the aminoalkylindole WIN55,212-2 and radiation in breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "The potential antitumor activity of cannabinoid receptor agonists, such as the aminoalklylindole WIN55,212-2 (WIN2), has been studied extensively, but their potential interaction with conventional cancer therapies, such as radiation, remains unknown. In the present work, the influence of WIN2 on the antiproliferative activity of radiation in human (MCF-7 and MDA-MB231) and murine (4T1) breast cancer cells was investigated. The antiproliferative effects produced by combination of WIN2 and radiation were more effective than either agent alone. The stereoisomer of WIN2, WIN55,212-3 (WIN3), failed to inhibit growth or potentiate the growth-inhibitory effects of radiation, indicative of stereospecificity. Two other aminoalkylindoles, pravadoline and JWH-015 [(2-methyl-1-propyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-naphthalenyl-methanone], also enhanced the antiproliferative effects of radiation, but other synthetic cannabinoids (i.e., nabilone, CP55,940 [(+)-rel-5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-[(1R,2R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]-phenol], and methanandamide) or phytocannabinoids [i.e., \u0394\u2079-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol] did not. The combination treatment of WIN2 + radiation promoted both autophagy and senescence but not apoptosis or necrosis. WIN2 also failed to alter radiation-induced DNA damage or the apparent rate of DNA repair. Although the antiproliferative actions of WIN2 were mediated through noncannabinoid receptor-mediated pathways, the observation that WIN2 interfered with growth stimulation by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) implicates the potential involvement of S1P/ceramide signaling pathways. In addition to demonstrating that aminoalkylindole compounds could potentially augment the effectiveness of radiation treatment in breast cancer, the present study suggests that THC and nabilone are unlikely to interfere with the effectiveness of radiation therapy, which is of particular relevance to patients using cannabinoid-based drugs to ameliorate the toxicity of cancer therapies.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2013-11-22", "authors": ["Sean MEmery", "Moureq RAlotaibi", "QingTao", "Dana ESelley", "Aron HLichtman", "David AGewirtz"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.113.205120"}

{"title": "Follistatin is induced by ionizing radiation and potentially predictive of radiosensitivity in radiation-induced fibrosis patient derived fibroblasts.", "abstract": "Follistatin is a potent regulator of the inflammatory response and binds to and inhibits activin A action. Activin A is a member of the TGF\u03b2 protein superfamily which has regulatory roles in the inflammatory response and in the fibrotic process. Fibrosis can occur following cell injury and cell death induced by agents such as ionizing radiation (IR). IR is used to treat cancer and marked fibrotic response is a normal tissue (non-tumour) consequence in a fraction of patients under the current dose regimes. The discovery and development of a therapeutic to abate fibrosis in these radiosensitive patients would be a major advance for cancer radiotherapy. Likewise, prediction of which patients are susceptible to fibrosis would enable individualization of treatment and provide an opportunity for pre-emptive fibrosis control and better tumour treatment outcomes. The levels of activin A and follistatin were measured in fibroblasts derived from patients who developed severe radiation-induced fibrosis following radiotherapy and compared to fibroblasts from patients who did not. Both follistatin and activin A gene expression levels were increased following IR and the follistatin gene expression level was lower in the fibroblasts from fibrosis patients compared to controls at both basal levels and after IR. The major follistatin transcript variants were found to have a similar response to IR and both were reduced in fibrosis patients. Levels of follistatin and activin A secreted in the fibroblast culture medium also increased in response to IR and the relative follistatin protein levels were significantly lower in the samples derived from fibrosis patients. The decrease in the follistatin levels can lead to an increased bioactivity of activin A and hence may provide a useful measurement to identify patients at risk of a severe fibrotic response to IR. Additionally, follistatin, by its ability to neutralise the actions of activin A may be of value as an anti-fibrotic for radiation induced fibrosis.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-11-10", "authors": ["Helen BForrester", "AlesiaIvashkevich", "Michael JMcKay", "TrevorLeong", "David Mde Kretser", "Carl NSprung"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0077119"}

Tamoxifen\u2010resistant cells were enriched for stem/progenitors and expressed high levels of the stem cell marker Sox2. Silencing of the SOX2 gene reduced the size of the stem/progenitor cell population and restored sensitivity to tamoxifen. Conversely, ectopic expression of Sox2 reduced tamoxifen sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Gene expression profiling revealed activation of the Wnt signalling pathway in Sox2\u2010expressing cells, and inhibition of Wnt signalling sensitized resistant cells to tamoxifen. Examination of patient tumours indicated that Sox2 levels are higher in patients after endocrine therapy failure, and also in the primary tumours of these patients, compared to those of responders.

Here, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the activity of ganetespib, a potent inhibitor of HSP90, in this malignancy.\nThe antitumor and antimetastatic activity of ganetespib was investigated using TNBC cell lines and xenograft models. Combinatorial drug analyses were performed with chemotherapeutic agents and concomitant effects on DNA damage and cell-cycle disruption were assessed in vitro; antitumor efficacy was assessed in vivo. Metabolic and objective tumor responses were evaluated in patients with metastatic TNBC undergoing ganetespib treatment.\nGanetespib simultaneously deactivated multiple oncogenic pathways to potently reduce cell viability in TNBC cell lines, and suppressed lung metastases in experimental models. Ganetespib potentiated the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin via enhanced DNA damage and mitotic arrest, conferring superior efficacy to the doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen in TNBC xenografts. Ganetespib also promoted mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis in combination with taxanes in vitro, and these effects translated to significantly improved combinatorial activity in vivo.

The skeleton is also the preferential initial metastatic site in breast and prostate carcinomas. Objective complications of bone metastases are named \u00ab skeletal-related events \u00bb (SREs) and generally include the need for radiotherapy on bone, surgery to bone, pathologic fracture and spinal cord compression. Recent phase III double-blind trials have demonstrated the superiority of denosumab to zoledronic acid for delaying the time to first SRE in patients with breast or prostate cancer and bone metastases. Non-inferiority was shown in the trial including other solid tumors and multiple myeloma. The overall burden of the disease was also significantly reduced in the breast and prostate cancer studies, and in the pre-specified integrated analysis that included all three comparative trials. Denosumab is conveniently administered by subcutaneous injections and is devoid of renal toxicity. However, denosumab induces more cases of hypocalcaemia than zoledronate. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended during therapy and it is advised to regularly monitor calcium levels during denosumab long-term treatment. There are numerically more cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw, but the differences are not statistically significant between zoledronate and denosumab, whether in the individual studies or in the integrated analysis.

{"title": "Tumour hypoxia determines the potential of combining mTOR and autophagy inhibitors to treat mammary tumours.", "abstract": "Hypoxia can activate autophagy, a self-digest adaptive process that maintains cell turnover. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are used to treat cancer but also stimulate autophagy.\nHuman mammary cancer cells and derived xenografts were used to examine whether hypoxia could exacerbate autophagy-mediated resistance to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.\nRapamycin exerted potent antitumour effects in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 mammary tumours through a marked inhibition of angiogenesis, but the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) failed to further sensitise tumours to mTOR inhibition. Rapamycin treatment actually led to tumour reoxygenation, thereby preventing the development of autophagy. Chloroquine alone, however, blocked the growth of MCF-7 tumours and in vitro blunted the hypoxia-induced component of autophagy in these cells. Finally, when initiating CQ treatment in large, hypoxic tumours, a robust antitumour effect could be observed, which also further increased the antiproliferative effects of rapamycin.\nThe mTOR inhibitor rapamycin significantly contributes to tumour growth inhibition and normalisation of the tumour vasculature through potent antiangiogenic effects. The resulting reduction in hypoxia accounts for a lack of sensitisation by the autophagy inhibitor CQ, except if the tumours are already at an advanced stage, and thus largely hypoxic at the initiation of the combination of rapamycin and CQ treatment.", "journal": "British journal of cancer", "date": "2013-10-26", "authors": ["ESeront", "RBoidot", "CBouzin", "OKarroum", "B FJordan", "BGallez", "J-PMachiels", "OFeron"], "doi": "10.1038/bjc.2013.644"}

Thus, targeting the tumor vasculature along with the proliferation by dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be the efficient way of treating advanced breast cancers, which can be further enhanced by combining with radiotherapy. However, the effectiveness of radiotherapy may be severely compromised by toxicities and tumor resistance due to radiation-induced adaptive response contributing to recurrence and metastases of breast cancer. The rational of using ZD6474 is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of combined VEGFR2 and EGFR targeting with concurrent targeted and localized UV-B phototherapy in vitro breast cancer cells with the anticipation to cure skin lesions infiltrated with breast cancer cells.\nBreast cancer cells were exposed to UV-B and ZD6474 and the cell viability, apoptosis, invasion and motility studies were conducted for the combinatorial effect.

ZD6474 inhibited cyclin E expression and induced p53 expression when combined with UV-B. It activated stress induced mitochondrial pathway by inducing translocation of bax and cytochrome-c. The combination of ZD6474 with UV-B vs. either agent alone also more potently down-regulated the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein, up-regulated pro-apoptotic signaling events involving expression of bax, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 proteins, and induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in apoptosis.

Recent success of checkpoint blockade in highly immunogenic tumors has renewed interest in immunotherapy. Regulatory T (T reg) cells densely populate solid tumors, which may promote progression through suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. We investigated the role of T reg cells in murine mammary carcinogenesis using an orthotopic, polyoma middle-T antigen-driven model in Foxp3(DTR) knockin mice. T reg cell ablation resulted in significant determent of primary and metastatic tumor progression. Importantly, short-term ablation of T reg cells in advanced spontaneous tumors led to extensive apoptotic tumor cell death. This anti-tumor activity was dependent on IFN-\u03b3 and CD4(+) T cells but not on NK or CD8(+) T cells. Combination of T reg cell ablation with CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 blockade did not affect tumor growth or improve the therapeutic effect attained by T reg cell ablation alone. However, T reg cell targeting jointly with tumor irradiation significantly reduced tumor burden and improved overall survival. Together, our results demonstrate a major tumor-promoting role of T reg cells in an autochthonous model of tumorigenesis, and they reveal the potential therapeutic value of combining transient T reg cell ablation with radiotherapy for the management of poorly immunogenic, aggressive malignancies.", "journal": "The Journal of experimental medicine", "date": "2013-10-16", "authors": ["Paula DBos", "GeorgePlitas", "DipayanRudra", "Sue YLee", "Alexander YRudensky"], "doi": "10.1084/jem.20130762\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2982\n10.1038/nm.2438\n10.1038/nature04444\n10.1056/NEJMoa1200694\n10.1038/nri3405\n10.1126/science.1232227\n10.1073/pnas.0915174107\n10.1016/j.ccr.2009.06.018\n10.1093/annonc/mds262\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3687\n10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70082-8\n10.1084/jem.20122462\n10.1056/NEJMoa1003466\n10.1073/pnas.95.13.7556\n10.1038/ni1428\n10.4049/jimmunol.0804308\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1736\n10.1073/pnas.0702004104\n10.1002/eji.201041093\n10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63568-7\n10.1073/pnas.0701138104\n10.1084/jem.20112738\n10.1038/nrc3239\n10.1084/jem.20082492\n10.1073/pnas.0801197105\n10.1097/PPO.0b013e318250c001\n10.1172/JCI27745\n10.1084/jem.20091918\n10.1073/pnas.0509182102\n10.1126/science.1203486\n10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-13-0013\n10.1038/35074122\n10.1084/jem.20130579\n10.1038/nature09707\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1681\n10.1016/j.coi.2011.12.009\n10.1056/NEJMoa1200690\n10.1084/jem.190.3.355\n10.1084/jem.194.4.481\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1782\n10.1093/intimm/dxp072\n10.1038/nature03954\n10.1126/science.1160062"}

The risk of cardiac toxicity after anthracyclines and radiotherapy is recognized, but little is known about increased risk when these treatments are combined with ErbB2 inhibition. This study investigated whether ErbB2 inhibition increased radiation or anthracycline-induced toxicity. In an in vitro study, human cardiomyocytes were treated with irradiation or doxorubicin, alone or in combination with trastuzumab, and evaluated for cell survival and growth. Groups of mice received 0 or 14\u00a0Gy to the heart, alone or in combination with lapatinib, or 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0mg/kg doxorubicin alone or in combination with lapatinib. Mice were evaluated 40\u00a0weeks after treatment for cardiac damage. Changes in cardiac function ((99m)Tc-Myoview gated SPECT) were related to histomorphology and microvascular damage. Radiation or doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity (in vitro) were not exacerbated by trastuzumab. Cardiac irradiation of mice decreased microvascular density (MVD) and increased endothelial damage in surviving capillaries (decrease alkaline phosphatase expression and increased von Willebrand factor), but these changes were not exacerbated by lapatinib. Inflammatory responses in the irradiated epicardium (CD45+ and F4/80+ cells) were significantly reduced in combination with lapatinib. Irradiation, doxorubicin, and lapatinib each induced cardiac fibrosis but this was not further enhanced when treatments were combined. At the ultra-structural level, both lapatinib and doxorubicin induced mitochondrial damage, which was enhanced in combined treatments. Lapatinib alone also induced mild changes in cardiac function but this was not enhanced in the combined treatments. Trastuzumab did not enhance direct radiation or anthracycline toxicity of cardiomyocytes in vitro.

Dysregulation of phospholipase D (PLD) has been found in several human cancers and is associated with resistance to anticancer drugs. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of PLD inhibition on cell survival, cell death and DNA damage after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Combined IR treatment and PLD inhibition led to an increase in the radiation-induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells. The selective inhibition of PLD1 and PLD2 led to a significant decrease in the IR-induced colony formation of breast cancer cells. Moreover, PLD inhibition suppressed the radiation-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and enhanced the radiation-stimulated phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Furthermore, PLD inhibition, in combination with radiation, was very effective at inducing DNA damage, when compared with radiation alone.

However, the potential function of miR-21 in regulating tumor angiogenesis has been little disclosed. In this study, we treated the cultured 4T1 murine breast cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with miR-21 mimic, antagomir-21 or negative control (scramble), which were subjected to MTT, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting analysis. In addition, 4T1 cells were implanted beneath the right breast fat pad of the VEGFR2-luc transgenic mice, which were randomly divided into three groups and received saline, antagomir-21 or scramble treatment once respectively after tumor model establishment. Bioluminescent imaging was used to monitor tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo at 0d, 3d, 5d, 7d, 10d, and 14d after treatment. Mice were killed at the end of study and tumor tissues were collected for use. The results showed that knockdown of miR-21 by antagomir-21 decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis via targeting PTEN both in 4T1 cells and HUVECs. We also found the anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor effects of antagomir-21 in the VEGFR2-luc transgenic mouse model using bioluminescent imaging. Moreover, the Western blotting data revealed that antagomir-21 inhibited tumor angiogenesis through suppressing HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF/VEGFR2-associated signaling pathway.

{"title": "Expression and/or activity of the SVCT2 ascorbate transporter may be decreased in many aggressive cancers, suggesting potential utility for sodium bicarbonate and dehydroascorbic acid in cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimer transcription factor whose elevated activity in many cancers helps them to survive under hypoxic conditions and enhances their capacity to grow invasively, establish metastases, and survive chemo- or radiotherapy. Optimal intracellular levels of ascorbate suppress the level and transcriptional activity of HIF-1under normoxic or mildly hypoxic conditions by supporting the activity of proly and asparagyl hydroxylases that target HIF-1alpha. High intracellular ascorbate can also work in various ways to down-regulate activation of NF-kappaB which, like HIF-1 is constitutively active in many cancers and promotes aggressive behavior - in part by promoting transcription of HIF-1alpha. Yet recent evidence suggests that, even in the context of adequate ascorbate nutrition, the intracellular ascorbate content of many aggressive cancers may be supoptimal for effective HIF-1 control. This likely reflects low expression or activity of the SVCT2 ascorbate transporter. The expression of SVCT2 in cancers has so far received little study; but the extracellular acidity characteristic of many tumors would be expected to reduce the activity of this transporter, which has a mildly alkaline pH optimum. Unfortunately, since SVCT2 has a high affinity for ascorbate, and its activity is nearly saturated at normal healthy serum levels of this vitamin, increased oral administration of ascorbate would be unlikely to have much impact on the intracellular ascorbate content of tumors. However, cancers in which HIF-1 is active express high levels of glucose transporters such as GLUT-1, and these transporters can promote influx of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) via facilitated diffusion; once inside the cell, DHA is rapidly reduced to ascorbate, which effectively is \"trapped\" within the cell. Hence, episodic intravenous infusions of modest doses of DHA may have potential for optimizing the intracellular ascorbate content of cancers, potentially rendering them less aggressive. Indeed, several published studies have concluded that parenteral DHA--sometimes in quite modest doses--can retard the growth of transplanted tumors in rodents. As an alternative or adjunctive strategy, oral administration of sodium bicarbonate, by normalizing the extracellular pH of tumors, has the potential to boost the activity of SCTV2 in tumor cells, thereby promoting increased ascorbate uptake. Indeed, the utility of oral sodium bicarbonate for suppressing metastasis formation in nude mice xenografted with a human breast cancer has been reported. Hence, oral sodium bicarbonate and intravenous DHA may have the potential to blunt the aggressiveness of certain cancers in which suboptimal intracellular ascorbate levels contribute to elevated HIF-1 activity.", "journal": "Medical hypotheses", "date": "2013-08-07", "authors": ["Mark FMcCarty"], "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2013.07.023"}

We provide evidence that codepletion of PTEN and PNKP induces apoptosis. In HCT116 colon cancer cells, the loss of PTEN is accompanied by an increased background level of DNA double-strand breaks, which accumulate in the presence of an inhibitor of PNKP DNA 3'-phosphatase activity. Complementation of PC3 cells with several well-characterized mutated PTEN cDNAs indicated that the critical function of PTEN required to prevent toxicity induced by an inhibitor of PNKP is most likely associated with its cytoplasmic lipid phosphatase activity.

Specifically, we found that AI women lacked knowledge of details about screenings and their risks for getting breast cancer, cost was cited as a primary barrier to screening, additional education was needed (particularly materials that were AI focused), breast health was generally not discussed with others, and more instruction was requested for techniques used to identify bodily changes or abnormalities. Understanding attitudes of AI women not of recommended screening age may provide an insight into low screening rates among AI women. Furthermore, the results may inform outreach strategies to improve current and future screening rates.", "journal": "Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education", "date": "2013-07-03", "authors": ["Melissa KFilippi", "FlorenceNdikum-Moffor", "Stacy LBraiuca", "TiaGoodman", "Tara LHammer", "Aimee SJames", "Won SChoi", "K AllenGreiner", "Christine MDaley"], "doi": "10.1007/s13187-013-0499-4"}
{"title": "NQO1 prevents radiation-induced aneuploidy by interacting with Aurora-A.", "abstract": "Aneuploidy is the most common characteristic of human cancer cells. It also causes genomic instability, which is involved in the initiation of cancer development. Various lines of evidence indicate that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) plays an important role in cancer prevention, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that ionizing radiation (IR) induces substantial aneuploidy and centrosome amplification in NQO1-deficient cancer cells, suggesting that NQO1 plays a crucial role in preventing aneuploidy. NQO1 deficiency markedly increased the protein stability of Aurora-A in irradiated cancer cells. Small interfering RNA targeting Aurora-A effectively attenuated IR-induced centrosome amplification concerned with aneuploidy in NQO1-deficient cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that NQO1 specifically binds to Aurora-A via competing with the microtubule-binding protein, TPX2 (targeting protein for Xklp2), and contributes to the degradation of Aurora-A. Our results collectively demonstrate that NQO1 plays a key role in suppressing IR-induced centrosome amplification and aneuploidy through a direct interaction with Aurora-A.", "journal": "Carcinogenesis", "date": "2013-06-28", "authors": ["Moon-TaekPark", "Eun-TaexOh", "Min-JeongSong", "HyemiLee", "Eun KyungChoi", "Heon JooPark"], "doi": "10.1093/carcin/bgt225"}

This study aimed to investigate the impact of co-inhibition of EGFR and IGF-1R on the radiosensitivity of two breast cancer cells with different profiles of EGFR and IGF-1R expression.\nThe MCF-7 (EGFR +/-, IGF-1R +++) and MDA-MB-468 (EGFR +++, IGF-1R +++) breast cancer cell lines were used. Radiosensitizing effects were determined by colony formation assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were measured by flow cytometry. Phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk1/2 were quantified by western blot. In vivo studies were conducted using MDA-MB-468 cells xenografted in nu/nu mice.\nIn MDA-MB-468 cells, the inhibition of IGF-1R upregulated the p-EGFR expression. Either EGFR (AG1478) or IGF-1R inhibitor (AG1024) radiosensitized MDA-MB-468 cells. In MCF-7 cells, radiosensitivity was enhanced by AG1024, but not by AG1478. Synergistical radiosensitizing effect was observed by co-inhibition of EGFR and IGF-1R only in MDA-MB-468 cells with a DMF10% of 1.90. The co-inhibition plus irradiation significantly induced more apoptosis and arrested the cells at G0/G1 phase in MDA-MB-468 cells. Only co-inhibition of EGFR and IGF-1R synergistically diminished the expression of p-Akt and p-Erk1/2 in MDA-MB-468 cells. In vivo studies further verified the radiosensitizing effects by co-inhibition of both pathways in a MDA-MB-468 xenograft model.\nOur data suggested that co-inhibition of EGFR and IGF-1R synergistically radiosensitized breast cancer cells with both EGFR and IGF-1R high expression.

{"title": "Antioxidant enzymes mediate survival of breast cancer cells deprived of extracellular matrix.", "abstract": "Metastasis by cancer cells relies upon the acquisition of the ability to evade anoikis, a cell death process elicited by detachment from extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular mechanisms that ECM-detached cancer cells use to survive are not understood. Striking increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) occur in ECM-detached mammary epithelial cells, threatening cell viability by inhibiting ATP production, suggesting that ROS must be neutralized if cells are to survive ECM-detachment. Here, we report the discovery of a prominent role for antioxidant enzymes, including catalase and superoxide dismutase, in facilitating the survival of breast cancer cells after ECM-detachment. Enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes in nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells detached from ECM resulted in ATP elevation and survival in the luminal space of mammary acini. Conversely, silencing antioxidant enzyme expression in multiple breast cancer cell lines caused ATP reduction and compromised anchorage-independent growth. Notably, antioxidant enzyme-deficient cancer cells were compromised in their ability to form tumors in mice. In aggregate, our results reveal a vital role for antioxidant enzyme activity in maintaining metabolic activity and anchorage-independent growth in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, these findings imply that eliminating antioxidant enzyme activity may be an effective strategy to enhance susceptibility to cell death in cancer cells that may otherwise survive ECM-detachment.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2013-06-19", "authors": ["Calli ADavison", "Sienna MDurbin", "Matthew RThau", "Victoria RZellmer", "Sarah EChapman", "JustinDiener", "ConnorWathen", "W MatthewLeevy", "Zachary TSchafer"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2482"}

The ability of AD-01 to inhibit the self-renewal capacity of BCSCs was confirmed; mammospheres were completely eradicated by the third generation. The mechanism seems to be due to AD-01-mediated BCSC differentiation shown by a significant decrease in the number of holoclones and an associated increase in meroclones/paraclones; the stem cell markers, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, were also significantly reduced. Furthermore, we showed additive inhibitory effects when AD-01 was combined with the Notch inhibitor, DAPT. AD-01 was also able to abrogate a chemo- and radiotherapy-induced enrichment in BCSCs. Finally, FKBPL knockdown led to an increase in Nanog/Oct4/Sox2 and an increase in BCSCs, highlighting a role for endogenous FKBPL in stem cell signaling.\nAD-01 has dual antiangiogenic and anti-BCSC activity, which will be advantageous as this agent enters clinical trial.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2013-06-07", "authors": ["LanaMcClements", "AnitaYakkundi", "AngelosPapaspyropoulos", "HannahHarrison", "Matthew PAblett", "Puthen VJithesh", "Hayley DMcKeen", "RachelBennett", "ChristopherDonley", "AdrienKissenpfennig", "StuartMcIntosh", "Helen OMcCarthy", "EricO'Neill", "Robert BClarke", "TracyRobson"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0595"}

A significant proportion of well-differentiated thyroid tumors are unable to concentrate sufficient radioiodine for effective therapy, and in other tumor models such as breast tumors, where radioiodine uptake would be an attractive therapeutic option, uptake is insufficient.\nPituitary tumor-transforming gene-binding factor (PBF; PTTG1IP) is overexpressed in multiple cancers and significantly decreases NIS expression at the PM. The goal of this study was to identify a method by which PBF repression of NIS may be overcome in human tumors.\nHere, we identify PBF as a tyrosine phosphoprotein that specifically binds the proto-oncogene tyrosine protein kinase Src in mass spectrometry, glutathione S-transferase pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Src induction leads to phosphorylation at PBF residue Y174. Abrogation of this residue results in PM retention and a markedly reduced ability to bind NIS. The Src inhibitor PP1 inhibits PBF phosphorylation in multiple cell lines in vitro, including human primary thyroid cells. Of direct clinical importance to the treatment of thyroid cancer, PP1 stimulates iodide uptake by transfected NIS in TPC1 thyroid carcinoma cells and entirely overcomes PBF repression of iodide uptake in human primary thyroid cells.\nWe propose that targeting PBF phosphorylation at residue Y174 via tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of ablative radioiodine treatment in thyroid and other endocrine and endocrine-related tumors.", "journal": "The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism", "date": "2013-05-17", "authors": ["V ESmith", "NSharma", "R JWatkins", "M LRead", "G ARyan", "P PKwan", "AMartin", "J CWatkinson", "KBoelaert", "J AFranklyn", "C JMcCabe"], "doi": "10.1210/jc.2012-3640"}

{"title": "Rapid and automated multidimensional fluorescence microscopy profiling of 3D human breast cultures.", "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture provides a physiologically relevant microenvironment for distinguishing malignant from non-malignant breast cell phenotypes. 3D culture assays can also be used to test novel cancer therapies and predict a differential response to radiation between normal and malignant cells in vivo. However, biological measurements in such complex models are difficult to quantify and current approaches do not allow for in-depth multifaceted assessment of individual colonies or unique sub-populations within the entire culture. This is in part due to the limitations of imaging at a range of depths in 3D culture resulting from optical aberrations and intensity attenuation. Here, we address these limitations by combining sample smearing techniques with high-throughput 2D imaging algorithms to accurately and rapidly quantify imaging features acquired from 3D cultures. Multiple high resolution imaging features especially designed to characterize 3D cultures show that non-malignant human breast cells surviving large doses of ionizing radiation acquire a \"swelled acinar\" phenotype with fewer and larger nuclei, loss of cell connectivity and diffused basement membrane. When integrating these imaging features into hierarchical clustering classification, we could also identify subpopulations of phenotypes from individual human tumor colonies treated with ionizing radiation or/and integrin inhibitors. Such tools have therefore the potential to further characterize cell culture populations after cancer treatment and identify novel phenotypes of resistance.", "journal": "Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro", "date": "2013-02-15", "authors": ["Catherine CPark", "WalterGeorgescu", "ArisPolyzos", "ChristopherPham", "Kazi MAhmed", "HuiZhang", "Sylvain VCostes"], "doi": "10.1039/c3ib20275e"}
{"title": "Radiosensitization of brain metastasis by targeting c-MET.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy is the most widely used therapeutic modality in brain metastasis; however, it only provides palliation due to inevitable tumor recurrence. Resistance of tumor cells to ionizing radiation is a major cause of treatment failure. A critical unmet need in oncology is to develop rationale driven approaches that can enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy against metastatic tumor. Utilizing in vivo orthotopic primary tumor and brain metastasis models that recapitulate clinical situation of the patients with metastatic breast cancer, we investigated a molecular mechanism through which metastatic tumor cells acquire resistance to radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-c-Met pathway is essential for the pathologic development and progression of many human cancers such as proliferation, invasion and resistance to anticancer therapies. In this study, c-Met signaling activity as well as total c-Met expression was significantly upregulated in both breast cancer cell lines irradiated in vitro and ex vivo radio-resistant cells derived from breast cancer brain metastatic xenografts. To interrogate the role of c-Met signaling in radioresistance of brain metastasis, we evaluated the effects on tumor cell viability, clonogenicity, sensitivity to radiation, and in vitro/in vivo tumor growth after targeting c-Met by small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) or small-molecule kinase inhibitor (PF-2341066). Although c-Met silencing or radiation alone demonstrated a modest decrease in clonogenic growth of parental breast cancers and brain metastatic derivatives, combination of two modalities showed synergistic antitumor effects resulting in significant prolongation of overall survival in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, optimizing c-Met targeting in combination with radiation is critical to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the treatments of brain metastasis.", "journal": "Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology", "date": "2013-02-06", "authors": ["HeekyoungYang", "Hye WonLee", "YonghyunKim", "YeriLee", "Yeon-SookChoi", "Kang HoKim", "JuyounJin", "JeongwuLee", "Kyeung MinJoo", "Do-HyunNam"], "doi": "10.1038/labinvest.2012.180"}

Mice with subcutaneous EGFR and IGF-1R-expressing SUM149 xenografts received a single dose of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) or saline. After 4 days, mice were injected with radiolabeled cetuximab or R1507, an anti-IGF-1R antibody. A control group received a radiolabeled irrelevant IgG (hLL2). Three days later, SPECT/CT images were acquired and mice were dissected to determine the concentration of antibodies in the tissues. Tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically to determine vascular density (CD34), VEGF, EGFR and IGF-1R expression. SPECT/CT imaging revealed that bevacizumab treatment significantly reduced tumor targeting of radiolabeled cetuximab by 40% from 33.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 %ID/g to 19.8\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7 %ID/g (p\u2009=\u20090.009) for untreated and bevacizumab-treated tumors, respectively.

Uptake in normal organs was not altered by bevacizumab. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that vascular density decreased with 43%, whereas EGFR and IGF-1R expression was unaltered.

We evaluated the effectiveness and limitations of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BM) from BC in conjunction with molecular targeting chemotherapy. Outcomes were retrospectively reviewed in 80 consecutive patients who underwent gamma knife SRS for BM from BC between January 2009 and February 2012. The overall survival (OS), neurological death-free survival (NS) and local tumor control endpoints were calculated, and prognostic factors were investigated using proportional hazards models.

The rates of 1- and 2-year OS after SRS were 50 and 26 %, respectively. The median survival time (MST) was 11.4 months. HER2-overexpression (P < 0.001), recursive partitioning analysis class (P = 0.018) and total planning target volume on initial SRS (P = 0.004) were associated with OS.

Thus, many efforts are being devoted to developing CSC-targeted therapies to overcome the resistance of CSCs to conventional anti-cancer therapies and decrease cancer recurrence. Differentiation therapy is one potential approach to achieve CSC-targeted therapies. This method involves inducing immature cancer cells with stem cell characteristics into more mature or differentiated cancer cells. In this study, we found that a CDK4 inhibitor sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells but not MCF7 cells to irradiation. This difference appeared to be associated with the relative percentage of CSC-population between the two breast cancer cells. The CDK4 inhibitor induced differentiation and reduced the cancer stem cell activity of MDA-MB-231 cells, which are shown by multiple marker or phenotypes of CSCs. Thus, these results suggest that radiosensitization effects may be caused by reducing the CSC-population of MDA-MB-231 through the use of the CDK4 inhibitor.

In this study, MCF-7 cells were exposed to IR in vitro and in vivo with or without pretreatment of BMS. The effects of BMS on the repair of IR-induced DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) were analyzed by the DR-GFP and EJ5-GFP reporter assays and IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX, 53BP1, Brca1 and Rad51 foci assays. The mechanisms by which BMS inhibits HR were examined by microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The effects of BMS on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to IR were determined by MTT and clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor growth inhibition in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. The results showed that BMS selectively inhibited HR repair of DSBs in MCF-7 cells, most likely by down-regulation of several genes that participate in HR. This resulted in a significant increase in the DNA damage response that sensitizes MCF-7 cells to IR-induced cell death in an apoptosis-independent manner. Furthermore, BMS treatment sensitized MCF-7 xenograft tumors to radiation therapy in vivo in an association with a significant delay in the repair of IR-induced DSBs.

Furthermore, the predictive factors for dual inhibition are unknown.\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (n=12) with the most frequent oncogenic backgrounds (K-Ras mut n=3, EGFR mut n=3, ALK translocated n=3, and triple-negative n=3) were exposed to PI3K inhibitors (ZSTK474, PI-103) or MEK inhibitor (CI-1040) alone or in combination and analysed with an MTS growth/cytotoxicity assay and statistically by combination index analysis. The activity of the intracellular signaling pathways in response to the inhibitor treatments was analysed with a western blot using phospho-specific antibodies to AKT, ERK1/2, S6, and 4E-BPI. For the differential dosing schedule experiments, additional breast and colon cancer cell lines known to be sensitive to dual inhibition were included.\nTwo of the 12 NSCLC cell lines tested, H3122 (ALK translocated) and H1437 (triple-negative), showed increased cytotoxicity upon dual MEK and PI3K inhibition. Furthermore, MDA-MB231 (breast) and HCT116 (colon), showed increased cytotoxicity upon dual inhibition, as in previous studies. Activation of parallel pathways in the dual inhibition-sensitive lines was also noted in response to single inhibitor treatment. Otherwise, no significant differences in downstream intracellular pathway activity (S6 and 4E-BPI) were noted between PI3K alone and dual inhibition other than the increased cytotoxicity of the latter. In the alternative dosing schedules two out of the four dual inhibition-sensitive cell lines showed similar cytotoxicity to continuous PI3K and short (15min) MEK inhibition treatment.\nTherapy with a dual PI3K and MEK inhibitor combination is more efficient than either inhibitor alone in some NSCLC cell lines. Responses to dual inhibition were not associated with any specific oncogenic genotype and no other predictive factors for dual inhibition were noted. The maximal effect of the dual PI3K and MEK inhibition can be achieved with alternative dosing schedules which are potentially more tolerable clinically.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2012-12-25", "authors": ["ElinaJokinen", "NiinaLaurila", "Jussi PKoivunen"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-12-612\n10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013\n10.1073/pnas.0905056106\n10.1038/nature04304\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0317\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.10.031\n10.1073/pnas.0907325106\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-4765\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-2925\n10.1126/science.1099314\n10.1200/JCO.2009.22.6993\n10.1038/nature05945\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0168\n10.1056/NEJMoa0810699\n10.1056/NEJMoa1006448\n10.1038/10533\n10.1093/jnci/djj133\n10.1248/bpb.32.297\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-1601\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0099\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1515\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.05.023"}
{"title": "Inhibition of EZH2 suppresses self-renewal and induces radiation sensitivity in atypical rhabdoid teratoid tumor cells.", "abstract": "Overexpression of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunit Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) occurs in several malignancies, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, medulloblastoma, and glioblastoma multiforme. Recent evidence suggests that EZH2 may also have a role in rhabdoid tumors. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare, high-grade embryonal brain tumor that occurs most commonly in young children and carries a very poor prognosis. ATRTs are characterized by absence of the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCB1. Given the role of EZH2 in regulating epigenetic changes, we investigated the role of EZH2 in ATRT.\nMicroarray analysis was used to evaluate expression of EZH2 in ATRT tumor samples. We used shRNA and a chemical inhibitor of EZH2 to examine the impact of EZH2 inhibition on cell growth, proliferation, and tumor cell self-renewal.\nHere, we show that targeted disruption of EZH2 by RNAi or pharmacologic inhibition strongly impairs ATRT cell growth, suppresses tumor cell self-renewal, induces apoptosis, and potently sensitizes these cells to radiation. Using functional analysis of transcription factor activity, we found the cyclin D1-E2F axis to be repressed after EZH2 depletion in ATRT cells.\nOur observations provide evidence that EZH2 disruption alters cell cycle progression and may be an important new therapeutic target, particularly in combination with radiation, in ATRT.", "journal": "Neuro-oncology", "date": "2012-11-30", "authors": ["IrinaAlimova", "Diane KBirks", "Peter SHarris", "Jeffrey AKnipstein", "SujathaVenkataraman", "Victor EMarquez", "Nicholas KForeman", "RajeevVibhakar"], "doi": "10.1093/neuonc/nos285\n10.3171/jns.1996.85.1.0056\n10.1002/cncr.27373\n10.1002/pbc.21578\n10.1007/s11060-004-4276-4\n10.1093/emboj/cdg542\n10.1073/pnas.1933744100\n10.1111/j.1365-2990.2010.01132.x\n10.1038/nature01075\n10.1126/science.10769971076997[pii]\n10.1016/j.gde.2004.02.001\n10.1101/gad.1035902\n10.1038/nrd1930\n10.1101/gad.1524107\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0013\n10.1016/j.ccr.2010.09.006\n10.1093/neuonc/nor140\n10.1073/pnas.0506580102\n10.1002/ijc.27455\n10.1073/pnas.1002530107\n10.1016/j.molcel.2008.10.016\n10.1371/journal.pgen.1000242\n10.1038/nature04733\n10.1101/gad.415507\n10.1038/nrm2469\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-1622\n10.1200/JCO.2004.07.073\n10.1038/ng0210-100\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0398\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2156\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208771\n10.1038/sj.onc.1207706\n10.1038/sj.onc.1209112\n10.1073/pnas.0505300102\n10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06447.x\n10.1016/j.jhep.2010.01.027\n10.1016/j.stem.2010.08.002"}
{"title": "The role of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in the breast cancer cell response to DNA-damaging agents.", "abstract": "Following exposure to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can modulate the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) by forming protein complexes that include the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs). This is one of the key mechanism by which tumors become resistant to DNA-damaging therapies. Our previous studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is a substrate for DNA-PKcs, and can transactivate EGFR. We therefore questioned whether IGFBP-3 might interact with the EGFR-DNA-PK complex that regulates the DNA damage response. The aim of this study was to delineate the role of IGFBP-3 in the response of breast cancer cells to DSB-inducing chemotherapeutic agents. In the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T, which express IGFBP-3 highly, nuclear localization of EGFR and IGFBP-3 was enhanced by treatment with cytotoxic drugs etoposide or doxorubicin and reduced by the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Enhanced association among IGFBP-3, EGFR and DNA-PKcs, following the exposure to DNA-damaging drugs was supported by both co-immunoprecipitation analysis and direct visualization by proximity ligation assay. The activation of DNA-PKcs at Ser2056, DNA repair as measured by a nonhomologous end-joining assay, and the increase in EGFR and DNA-PKcs interaction induced by DNA-damaging agents, were all decreased by IGFBP-3 silencing, suggesting that IGFBP-3 has an obligatory role in the DNA repair response to DNA-damaging therapy. In conclusion, IGFBP-3 co-translocation to the nucleus of breast cancer cells and its formation of a complex with DNA-PKcs and EGFR in response to DNA damage shows its potential involvement in the regulation of DNA repair. This suggests the possibility of a therapeutic approach for sensitizing breast cancer to chemo- or radiotherapy by targeting the DNA repair function of IGFBP-3.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2012-11-28", "authors": ["M ZLin", "K AMarzec", "J LMartin", "R CBaxter"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2012.538"}

The diagnosis of IBC is made based on clinical features, including the presence of skin edema and erythema involving at least one-third of the breast, with or without a mass, and usually associated with dermal lymphatic invasion (DLI) on skin biopsy. Management requires combined modality therapy, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an anthracycline and taxane-based regimen, followed by surgery and radiotherapy, plus concurrent anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, and endocrine therapy for at least 5 years after surgery for estrogen-receptor-positive disease (Fig. 1). There have been few large clinical trials focused on IBC; therefore, most data regarding treatment are derived from retrospective analyses, small studies, and extrapolation of results from trials of noninflammatory locally advanced breast cancer. Patients with IBC should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials whenever possible.

Early detection of breast cancer can increase treatment options and patients' survivability. Mammography is the gold standard for breast imaging and cancer detection.

Recently, computer-aided detection or diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to help radiologists in order to increase diagnosis accuracy. Generally, a CAD system consists of four stages: (a) preprocessing, (b) segmentation of regions of interest, (c) feature extraction and selection, and finally (d) classification.

{"title": "Moscatilin inhibits migration and metastasis of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells through inhibition of Akt and Twist signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Breast cancer metastasis is more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy than is cancer of the visceral tissues; therefore, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Moscatilin, derived from the orchid Dendrobrium loddigesii, has shown anticancer activity. We evaluated the mechanism by which moscatilin suppresses the migration and metastasis of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that moscatilin significantly inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell migration by using scratch assays and Boyden chambers. Transcriptional factors inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as Twist, Snail, and Akt, play important roles in cell migration and cancer metastasis. Moscatilin inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of Twist, but not that of Snail, and subsequently inhibited N-cadherin expression. However, these effects were reversed by constitutively expressing active myristoylated (myr)-Akt and Twist overexpression. Moscatilin also suppressed Akt phosphorylation. However, Akt overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of moscatilin on phospho-Akt protein expression but not its effects on Twist. The moscatilin-mediated inhibition of cell migration was reversed by Akt and Twist overexpression, demonstrating that moscatilin blocked cell migration by inhibiting Akt and Twist. In an MDA-MB-231 metastatic animal model, moscatilin (100 mg/kg) significantly suppressed breast cancer metastasis to the lungs and reduced the number of metastatic lung nodules and lung weight without causing any toxicity. These results indicated that moscatilin inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration via Akt- and Twist-dependent pathways; this finding was consistent with moscatilin's antimetastatic activity in vivo. Therefore, moscatilin may be an effective compound for the prevention of human breast cancer metastasis.", "journal": "Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)", "date": "2012-09-11", "authors": ["Hui-ChenPai", "Li-HsunChang", "Chieh-YuPeng", "Ya-LingChang", "Chien-ChihChen", "Chien-ChangShen", "Che-MingTeng", "Shiow-LinPan"], "doi": "10.1007/s00109-012-0945-5"}

Recently, \u00b9\u00b3C MRS-detectable hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate conversion has been validated in models as a noninvasive imaging method for the detection of tumors and treatment response, and has successfully passed phase I clinical trials. To date, response to treatment has been associated with a decrease in hyperpolarized lactate production. In this study, we monitored the effect of treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 in prostate and breast cancer cells. Following treatment, we observed a 31% decrease in the flux of hyperpolarized \u00b9\u00b3C label in treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells relative to controls. In contrast, and unexpectedly, the flux increased to 167% in treated PC3 prostate cancer cells. To mechanistically explain these observations, we investigated treatment-induced changes in the different factors known to affect the pyruvate to lactate conversion. NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) levels remained unchanged, whereas lactate dehydrogenase expression and activity, as well as intracellular lactate, increased in both cell lines, providing an explanation for the elevated hyperpolarized lactate observed in PC3 cells. The expression of MCT1, which mediates pyruvate transport, decreased in treated MCF-7, but not PC3, cells. This identifies pyruvate transport as rate limiting in U0126-treated MCF-7 cells and explains the decrease in hyperpolarized lactate observed in these cells following treatment. Our findings highlight the complexity of interactions between MEK and metabolism, and the need for mechanistic validation before hyperpolarized \u00b9\u00b3C MRS can be used to monitor treatment-induced molecular responses.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2012-09-05", "authors": ["AlessiaLodi", "Sarah MWoods", "Sabrina MRonen"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.2848"}

Unfortunately, tumor cells may develop resistance to endocrine therapy, which become a major obstacle limiting the success of breast cancer treatment.

In 63 patients (95.5%), HFRT delivered a total dose of 32.5 Gy to the whole breast within 5 wk (five fractions, one fraction per week). Other fractionations were chosen in three patients for the patients' personal convenience. A subsequent boost to the tumor bed was delivered in 35 patients (53.0%). Acute toxicities were scored according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v3. Late toxicity was defined as any toxicity occurring more than 6 mo after completion of HFRT and was scored according to the Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force-Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic scale.\nAt the end of the HFRT course, 19 patients (28.8%) had no irradiation-related toxicity. Acute grade 1-2 epithelitis was observed in 46 patients (69.7%). One grade 3 toxicity (1.5%) was observed. With a median follow-up of 34 mo (range: 12-94 mo), 31 patients (47%) had no toxicity, and 35 patients (53%) presented with grade 1-2 fibrosis.

It is increasingly evident that BCBM arises as a function of the biology of the primary tumor and the metastatic niche, which combine to create a unique microenvironment in the brain impacting both metastatic colonization and therapeutic response. Clinical outcomes are improving for BCBM patients as a result of modern combinatorial therapies, challenging the traditionally nihilistic approach to this patient subgroup. This review will focus on the breast cancer subtypes with the highest incidence of BCBM-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, and triple-negative (estrogen receptor [ER]-negative, progesterone receptor [PR]-negative, and HER2-negative) breast cancer (TNBC)-and will characterize differences in the clinical behavior of brain metastases that arise from these different subtypes. We will also highlight some of the recent preclinical studies that may shed light on the biological mechanisms and mediators underlying brain metastases.

The analytical problem arises when the prevalent sampling is adopted for collecting failure times and, as a result, the covariates are incompletely observed due to their association with failure time. The proposed procedure for estimating propensity scores shares interesting features similar to the likelihood formulation in case-control study, but in our case it requires additional consideration in the intercept term. The result shows that the corrected propensity scores in logistic regression setting can be obtained through standard estimation procedure with specific adjustments on the intercept term. For causal estimation, two different types of missing sources are encountered in our model: one can be explained by potential outcome framework; the other is caused by the prevalent sampling scheme. Statistical analysis without adjusting bias from both sources of missingness will lead to biased results in causal inference.

{"title": "Autocrine human GH promotes radioresistance in mammary and endometrial carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Although recent advances in breast cancer treatment regimes have improved patient prognosis, resistance to breast cancer therapies, such as radiotherapy, is still a major clinical challenge. In the current study, we have investigated the role of autocrine human GH (hGH) in resistance to ionising radiation (IR)-based therapy. Cell viability and total cell number assays demonstrated that autocrine hGH promoted cell regrowth in the mammary carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-435S and T47D, and the endometrial carcinoma cell line, RL95-2, following treatment with IR. In addition, autocrine hGH enhanced MDA-MB-435S and T47D cell clonogenic survival following radiation exposure. The enhanced clonogenic survival afforded by autocrine hGH was mediated by JAK2 and Src kinases. Investigation into the DNA repair capacity demonstrated that autocrine hGH reduced IR-induced DNA damage in MDA-MB-435S and T47D cells. Functional antagonism of hGH increased RL95-2 sensitivity to IR in cell viability and total cell number assays, reduced clonogenic survival and enhanced the induction of DNA damage. Thus, autocrine hGH reduced sensitivity to treatment with IR in mammary and endometrial carcinoma cell lines in vitro, while functional antagonism of hGH sensitised endometrial carcinoma cells to IR. Functional antagonism of hGH, used in conjunction with radiotherapy, may therefore enhance treatment efficacy and improve the prognosis of patients with breast and endometrial cancer.", "journal": "Endocrine-related cancer", "date": "2012-07-19", "authors": ["Nicola MBougen", "MichaelSteiner", "MikhailPertziger", "ArindamBanerjee", "Severine EBrunet-Dunand", "TaoZhu", "Peter ELobie", "Jo KPerry"], "doi": "10.1530/ERC-12-0042"}

Postmenopausal women with breast cancer and MR imaging findings of the contralateral unaffected breast, before and during 6-12 months of AI treatment (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane), between August 1999 and June 2010 were retrospectively identified (n = 149). Two readers performed blinded side-by-side comparison of BPE and MR imaging-depicted FGT before and during treatment. BPE and FGT were classified as the same or greater on one of the two MR studies and by using categorical scales: minimal, mild, moderate, or marked for BPE and fatty, scattered, heterogeneously dense, or dense for FGT. Consensus was reached in cases of disagreement. The sign test was used to conduct a side-by-side comparison of BPE and FGT before and during AI treatment.\nA decrease in BPE occurred in 33.9% (37 of 109) of women during anastrozole treatment, while an increase occurred in only one (P < .0001); 28 of 37 decreases resulted in a category change of BPE.

In the present study, we attempted to explore the use of eIF4E as a therapeutic target to enhance radiosensitivity for breast carcinomas in a xenograft BALB/C mice model.\nNinety female BALB/C mice transfected with EMT-6 cells were randomly divided into six groups: control, irradiation (IR), pSecX-t4EBP1, pSecX-t4EBP1+irradiation, pSecX and pSecX+irradiation. At the end of the experiments, all mice were sacrificed, the xenografts were harvested to measure the tumor volume and mass, and the tumor inhibition rates were calculated. Apoptosis was detected with a flow cytometric assay. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of HIF-1\u03b1.\nThe xenografts in pSecX-t4EBP1 mice showed a significantly delayed growth and smaller tumor volume, with a higher tumor inhibition rate compared with the control and pSecX groups. A similar result was obtained in the pSecX-t4EBP1+IR group compared with IR alone and pSecX+irradiation. The expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in the tumor cells was significantly decreased, while the apoptosis index was much higher.\npSecX-t4EBP1 can significantly inhibit tumor growth and enhance the radiosensitivity of breast carcinoma xenografts in BALB/C mice.

The objective of this study was to compare breast and cervical cancer screening utilization among Hispanic and AI women that reside in rural areas of the Southwestern United States to their urban counterparts and to assess characteristics that influence cancer screening.\nThis study utilizes Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 2006 to 2008 for Arizona and New Mexico. The BRFSS is a federally funded telephone survey to collect data on risk factors contributing to the leading causes of death and chronic diseases.\nRural Hispanic and AI populations reported some differences in screening rates compared with their urban counterparts. Among Hispanic women, 58\u00a0% of rural residents reported having had a mammogram within the past year, compared with 66\u00a0% of urban residents.

Because of de novo and acquired resistance to endocrine therapy, there remains a need to identify which ER\u03b1-positive (ER\u03b1(+))/PR-positive (PR(+)) tumors are most likely to respond. The purpose of this study was to use estrogen- and progestin-based radiopharmaceuticals to image ER\u03b1 and PR in mouse mammary tumors at baseline and after hormonal therapy and to determine whether changes in these imaging biomarkers can serve as an early predictive indicator of therapeutic response.\nMammary adenocarcinomas that spontaneously develop in aged female mice deficient in signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) were used. Imaging of ER\u03b1 and PR in primary tumor-bearing mice and mice implanted with mammary cell lines (SSM1, SSM2, and SSM3) derived from primary STAT1-deficient (STAT1(-/-)) tumors was performed. Hormonal treatments consisted of estradiol, an ER agonist; letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor; and fulvestrant, a pure ER antagonist. Small-animal PET/CT was performed using (18)F-fluoroestradiol ((18)F-FES) for ER, (18)F-fluoro furanyl norprogesterone ((18)F-FFNP) for PR, and (18)F-FDG for glucose uptake. Tracer uptake in the tumor was quantified and compared with receptor concentration determined by in vitro assays of resected tumors.\nPrimary STAT1(-/-) mammary tumors and implanted SSM2 and SSM3 tumors showed high (18)F-FES and (18)F-FFNP uptake and were confirmed to be ER\u03b1(+)/PR(+). Classic estrogen-induced regulation of the progesterone receptor gene was demonstrated by increased (18)F-FFNP uptake of estradiol-treated SSM3 tumors. Treatment with fulvestrant decreased (18)F-FFNP, (18)F-FES, and (18)F-FDG uptake and inhibited growth of SSM3 tumors but decreased only (18)F-FES uptake in SSM2 tumors, with no effect on growth, despite both tumors being ER\u03b1(+)/PR(+). Decreased (18)F-FFNP uptake by SSM3 tumors occurred early after initiation of treatment, before measurable tumor growth inhibition.\nUsing small-animal PET, a profile was identified that distinguished fulvestrant-sensitive from fulvestrant-resistant ER\u03b1(+)/PR(+) tumors before changes in tumor size. This work demonstrates that imaging baseline tumoral (18)F-FES uptake and initial changes in (18)F-FFNP uptake in a noninvasive manner is a potentially useful strategy to identify responders and nonresponders to endocrine therapy at an early stage.", "journal": "Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine", "date": "2012-06-07", "authors": ["Amy MFowler", "Szeman RubyChan", "Terry LSharp", "Nicole MFettig", "DongZhou", "Carmen SDence", "Kathryn ECarlson", "MJeyakumar", "John AKatzenellenbogen", "Robert DSchreiber", "Michael JWelch"], "doi": "10.2967/jnumed.112.103465"}

Although the molecular mechanisms behind metastasis are poorly understood, it is clear that epigenetic dysregulation at the level of microRNA expression is a key characteristic of the metastatic process that can be exploited for therapy. Here, we describe an miRNA-targeted therapeutic approach for the prevention and arrest of lymph node metastasis. Therapy relies on the inhibition of the pro-metastatic microRNA-10b. It is delivered to primary and lymph node metastatic tumor cells using an imaging-capable nanodrug that is designed to specifically home to these tissues. Treatment of invasive human breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) with the nanodrug in vitro downregulates miR-10b and abolishes the invasion and migration of the tumor cells. After intravenous delivery to mice bearing orthotopic MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN tumors, the nanodrug accumulates in the primary tumor and lymph nodes. When treatment is initiated before metastasis to lymph nodes, metastasis is prevented. Treatment after the formation of lymph node metastases arrests the metastatic process without a concomitant effect on primary tumor growth raising the possibility of a context-dependent variation in miR-10b breast oncogenesis.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2012-05-15", "authors": ["M VYigit", "S KGhosh", "MKumar", "VPetkova", "AKavishwar", "AMoore", "ZMedarova"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2012.173"}

We seek to find optimal parameters for tangential beams to cover the whole ipsilateral breast (WB) and minimize the dose to the organs at risk (OARs).\nA support vector machine (SVM) based method is proposed to determine the optimal posterior plane of the tangential beams. Relative significances of including/avoiding the volumes of interests are incorporated into the cost function of the SVM. After finding the optimal 3-D plane that separates the whole breast (WB) and the included clinical target volumes (CTVs) from the OARs, the gantry angle, collimator angle, and posterior jaw size of the tangential beams are derived from the separating plane equation. Dosimetric measures of the treatment plans determined by the automated method are compared with those obtained by applying manual beam placement by the physicians. The method can be further extended to use multileaf collimator (MLC) blocking by optimizing posterior MLC positions.\nThe plans for 36 patients (23 prone- and 13 supine-treated) with left breast cancer were analyzed.

In the present studies, we investigated the role of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) in IR-induced G2/M checkpoint response and ERK1/2 activation, as well as in cell survival after IR.\nWith Rac1-specific inhibitor, dominant negative mutant Rac1 (N17Rac1) and specific small interfering RNA, the effect of Rac1 on IR-induced G2/M checkpoint response and ERK1/2 activation was examined in human breast cancer cells. In addition, the effect of Rac1 on cell survival after irradiation was assessed by using Rac1-specific inhibitor.\nIR exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was associated with a marked activation of Rac1 GTPase. Furthermore, inhibition of Rac1 by using specific inhibitor, dominant-negative Rac1 mutant, or specific siRNA resulted in attenuation of IR-induced G2/M arrest and concomitant diminution of IR-induced activation of ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 kinases, as well as phosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr15. Moreover, Rac1 inhibition or decreased Rac1 expression also abrogated IR-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2. Ultimately, inhibition of Rac1 markedly increased cellular sensitivity to IR exposure, which involves induction of apoptosis.\nStudies in this report suggest that Rac1 GTPase plays an essential role in the activation of IR-induced ERK1/2 signaling and subsequent G2/M checkpoint response. Furthermore, results also support a role for Rac1 in promoting cell survival after irradiation treatment.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2012-04-13", "authors": ["YingYan", "Patrick MGreer", "Phu TCao", "Ryan HKolb", "Kenneth HCowan"], "doi": "10.1186/bcr3164\n10.1016/j.gde.2003.12.003\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206682\n10.1101/gad.11.4.504\n10.1093/emboj/16.3.545\n10.1016/0092-8674(91)90266-2\n10.1073/pnas.89.7.2917\n10.1038/ncb994\n10.1038/nature03097\n10.1242/jcs.00735\n10.1007/s004120050256\n10.1083/jcb.145.2.225\n10.1128/MCB.22.4.1049-1059.2002\n10.1038/sj.onc.1210268\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206701\n10.1002/1098-2744(200012)29:4<219::AID-MC1004>3.0.CO;2-D\n10.1128/MCB.20.13.4543-4552.2000\n10.1074/jbc.274.5.2732\n10.1074/jbc.M111598200\n10.1007/s00018-008-8552-x\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203621\n10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990531)81:5<682::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-B\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203233\n10.1038/sj.onc.1208182\n10.1161/01.RES.0000216039.75913.9e\n10.1128/MCB.22.17.6023-6033.2002\n10.1038/24184\n10.1083/jcb.200212141\n10.1083/jcb.200801047\n10.1073/pnas.1009030107\n10.1073/pnas.0307512101\n10.1038/sj.onc.1203077\n10.1091/mbc.01-07-0358\n10.1074/jbc.M302878200\n10.1074/jbc.M109.071548\n10.1016/0092-8674(92)90164-8\n10.1074/jbc.M201147200\n10.1038/sj.onc.1201450\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1400\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0478\n10.3109/09553002.2011.622033\n10.1128/MCB.21.10.3445-3450.2001\n10.1038/371346a0\n10.1186/1476-4598-8-8\n10.1074/jbc.M801934200\n10.1016/j.canlet.2006.01.026\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0906\n10.1038/sj.onc.1204252\n10.1677/erc.1.01172\n10.1080/095530097143059\n10.3109/10409238.2011.575764\n10.1023/A:1006414422919"}

Inflammation is crucial for malignant tumor transformation and survival. Thus, blocking inflammation is expected to serve as an effective cancer treatment. Among anti-inflammation therapies, chemokine modulation is now beginning to emerge from the pipeline. CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12) interaction and the resulting cell signaling cascade have emerged as highly relevant targets since they play pleiotropic roles in metastatic progression. The unique function of CXCR4 is to promote the homing of tumor cells to their microenvironment at the distant organ sites.\nWe describe the actions of N,N'-(1,4-phenylenebis(methylene))dipyrimidin-2-amine (designated MSX-122), a novel small molecule and partial CXCR4 antagonist with properties quite unlike that of any other reported CXCR4 antagonists, which was prepared in a single chemical step using a reductive amination reaction. Its specificity toward CXCR4 was tested in a binding affinity assay and a ligand competition assay using (18)F-labeled MSX-122. The potency of the compound was determined in two functional assays, Matrigel invasion assay and cAMP modulation. The therapeutic potential of MSX-122 was evaluated in three different murine models for inflammation including an experimental colitis, carrageenan induced paw edema, and bleomycin induced lung fibrosis and three different animal models for metastasis including breast cancer micrometastasis in lung, head and neck cancer metastasis in lung, and uveal melanoma micrometastasis in liver in which CXCR4 was reported to play crucial roles.\nWe developed a novel small molecule, MSX-122, that is a partial CXCR4 antagonist without mobilizing stem cells, which can be safer for long-term blockade of metastasis than other reported CXCR4 antagonists.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2012-04-10", "authors": ["ZhongxingLiang", "WeiqiangZhan", "AizhiZhu", "YounghyounYoon", "SongbaiLin", "MaikoSasaki", "Jan-Michael AKlapproth", "HuaYang", "Hans EGrossniklaus", "JianguoXu", "MauricioRojas", "Ronald JVoll", "Mark MGoodman", "Richard FArrendale", "JinLiu", "C ChrisYun", "James PSnyder", "Dennis CLiotta", "HyunsukShim"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0034038"}

However, intrinsic radioresistance of cancer cells limits therapeutic efficacy. We have recently validated that SCF (SKP1, Cullins, and F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase is an attractive radiosensitizing target. Here we tested our hypothesis that MLN4924, a newly discovered investigational small molecule inhibitor of NAE (NEDD8 Activating Enzyme) that inactivates SCF E3 ligase, could act as a novel radiosensitizing agent in breast cancer cells. Indeed, we found that MLN4924 effectively inhibited cullin neddylation, and sensitized breast cancer cells to radiation with a sensitivity enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.75 for SK-BR-3 cells and 1.32 for MCF7 cells, respectively. Mechanistically, MLN4924 significantly enhanced radiation-induced G2/M arrest in SK-BR-3 cells, but not in MCF7 cells at early time point, and enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in both lines at later time point. However, blockage of apoptosis by Z-VAD failed to abrogate MLN4924 radiosensitization, suggesting that apoptosis was not causally related. We further showed that MLN4924 failed to enhance radiation-induced DNA damage response, but did cause minor delay in DNA damage repair. Among a number of tested SCF E3 substrates known to regulate growth arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage response, p21 was the only one showing an enhanced accumulation in MLN4924-radiation combination group, as compared to the single treatment groups. Importantly, p21 knockdown via siRNA partialy inhibited MLN4924-induced G2/M arrest and radiosensitization, indicating a causal role played by p21.

This pathway is imperative to the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. We aimed to investigate the radiosensitizing effects of the simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and PI3K in breast cancer cells.\nMCF-7 cell lines with low expression of EGFR and wild-type PTEN and MDA-MB-468 cell lines with high expression of EGFR and mutant PTEN were used. The radiosensitizing effects by the inhibition of EGFR with AG1478 and/or PI3K with Ly294002 were determined by colony formation assay, Western blot was used to investigate the effects on downstream signaling. Flow cytometry was used for apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. Mice-bearing xenografts of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were also used to observe the radiosensitizing effect.\nSimultaneous inhibition of EGFR and PI3K greatly enhanced radiosensitizing effect in MDA-MB-468 in terms of apoptosis and mitotic death, either inhibition of EGFR or PI3K alone could enhance radiosensitivity with a dose-modifying factor (DMF(SF2)) of 1.311 and 1.437, radiosensitizing effect was further enhanced by simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and PI3K with a DMF(SF2) at 2.698. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that dual inhibition combined with irradiation significantly induced G0/G1 phase arrest in MDA-MB-468 cells. The expression of phosphor-Akt and phosphor-Erk1/2 (induced by irradiation and PI3K inhibitor) were fully attenuated by simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors in combination with irradiation. In addition, dual inhibition combined with irradiation induced dramatic tumor growth delay in MDA-MB-468 xenografts.\nOur study indicated that simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and PI3K could further sensitize the cancer cells to irradiation compared to the single inhibitor with irradiation in vitro and in vivo.

{"title": "Prevention of breast cancer in the context of a national breast screening programme.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is not only increasing in the west but also particularly rapidly in eastern countries where traditionally the incidence has been low. The rise in incidence is mainly related to changes in reproductive patterns and lifestyle.

A model for this approach was the establishment of Family History Clinics (FHCs), which have resulted in improved survival in younger women at high risk. New predictive models of risk that include reproductive and lifestyle factors, mammographic density and measurement of risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may give more precise information concerning risk and enable better targeting for mammographic screening programmes and of preventive measures. Endocrine prevention using anti-oestrogens and aromatase inhibitors is effective, and observational studies suggest lifestyle modification may also be effective. However, referral to FHCs is opportunistic and predominantly includes younger women. A better approach for identifying older women at risk may be to use national breast screening programmes.

Mechanisms that regulate availability of CXCL12 in tumor microenvironments will substantially impact cancer progression and ongoing efforts to target the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway for cancer chemotherapy. We used dual luciferase imaging to investigate CXCR7-dependent scavenging of CXCL12 in breast tumors in vivo and quantify effects of CXCR7 on tumor growth and metastasis of a separate population of CXCR4+ breast cancer cells. In a mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer, in vivo imaging showed that malignant cells expressing CXCR7 reduced bioluminescent CXCL12 secreted in the primary tumor microenvironment. Capitalizing on sensitive detection of bioluminescent CXCL12, we also demonstrated that CXCR7+ cells reduced amounts of chemokine released from orthotopic tumors into the circulation. Immunofluorescence staining of human primary breast cancers showed expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 on malignant cells in \u224830% of cases. In most cases, CXCR4 and CXCR7 predominantly were expressed on separate populations of malignant cells in a tumor. We modeled these cases of human breast cancer by co-implanting tumor xenografts with CXCR4+ breast cancer cells, human mammary fibroblasts secreting CXCL12, and CXCR7+ or control breast cancer cells.

{"title": "Metabolic consequences of treatment with AKT inhibitor perifosine in breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with the development of numerous human cancers. As a result, many emerging therapies target this pathway. Previous studies have shown that targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway at the level of PI3K is associated with a drop in phosphocholine (PCho) and a reduction in hyperpolarized lactate production. However, the consequences of targeting downstream of PI3K at the level of Akt have not been investigated. Perifosine is an anticancer alkylphospholipid used in clinical trials. It acts by inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and has been shown to inhibit CTP-phosphocholine cytidyltransferase (CT). The goal of this study was to identify the MRS-detectable metabolic consequences of treatment with perifosine in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We found that perifosine treatment led to a 51\u2009\u00b1\u20095% drop in PCho from 30\u2009\u00b1\u20095 to 15\u2009\u00b1\u20091 fmol/cell and a comparable drop in de novo synthesized PCho. This was associated with a drop in choline kinase (ChoK) activity and ChoK\u03b1 expression. CT inhibition could not be ruled out but likely did not contribute to the change in PCho. We also found that intracellular lactate levels decreased from 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 to 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 fmol/cell and extracellular lactate levels dropped by a similar extent. These findings were consistent with a drop in lactate dehydrogenase expression and associated with a drop in activity of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1. The drops in PCho and lactate production following perifosine treatment are therefore mediated downstream of Akt by the drop in HIF-1\u03b1, which serves as the transcription factor for both ChoK and lactate dehydrogenase. The metabolic changes were confirmed in a second breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. Taken together, these findings indicate that PCho and lactate can serve as noninvasive metabolic biomarkers for monitoring the effects of inhibitors that target the PI3K/Akt pathway, independent of the step that leads to inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1.", "journal": "NMR in biomedicine", "date": "2012-01-19", "authors": ["Judy SSu", "Sarah MWoods", "Sabrina MRonen"], "doi": "10.1002/nbm.1764"}

A model of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis was used to determine the relative risks of SLMs for the different treatment techniques.\nA higher risk of SLMs was predicted for supine breast irradiation when compared with prone breast irradiation for both the standard fractionation and hypofractionation schedules (relative risk [RR] = 2.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.30-2.88, and RR = 2.68, 95% CI = 2.39-2.98, respectively). No difference in risk of SLMs was noted between standard fractionation and hypofractionation schedules in either the supine position (RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.97-1.14) or the prone position (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88-1.15).\nCompared with supine whole-breast irradiation, prone breast irradiation is associated with a significantly lower predicted risk of secondary lung malignancy. In this modeling study, fractionation schedule did not have an impact on the risk of SLMs in women treated with whole-breast RT for early breast cancer.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "2012-01-17", "authors": ["JohnNg", "IgorShuryak", "YanguangXu", "K SClifford Chao", "David JBrenner", "Ryan JBurri"], "doi": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.09.052"}

For this, we evaluated the known Her2 response to 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin hydrochloride (17-DMAG) treatment, an Hsp90 inhibitor.\nAfter in vitro 17-DMAG treatment response evaluation of MCF7 parental cells and 2 HER2-transfected clones (clone A medium, B high Her2 expression), we established human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice (only parental and clone B) for in vivo evaluation. Mice received 120 mg/kg of 17-DMAG in 4 doses at 12-hour intervals intraperitonially (n = 14) or PBS as carrier control (n = 9). Optical images were obtained both pretreatment (day 0) and posttreatment (day 3, 6, and 9), always 5 hours postinjection of 500 pmol of anti-Her2 Affibody-AlexaFluor680 via tail vein (with preinjection background subtraction). Days 3 and 9 in vivo optical imaging signal was further correlated with ex vivo Her2 levels by Western blot after sacrifice.\nHer2 expression decreased with 17-DMAG dose in vitro. In vivo optical imaging signal was reduced by 22.5% in clone B (P = 0.003) and by 9% in MCF7 parental tumors (P = 0.23) 3 days after 17-DMAG treatment; optical imaging signal recovered in both tumor types at days 6 to 9. In the carrier group, no signal reduction was observed. Pearson correlation of in vivo optical imaging signal with ex vivo Her2 levels ranged from 0.73 to 0.89.\nOptical imaging with an affibody can be used to noninvasively monitor changes in Her2 expression in vivo as a response to treatment with an Hsp90 inhibitor, with results similar to response measurements in positron emission tomography imaging studies.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2012-01-12", "authors": ["Stephanie M W Yvan de Ven", "Sjoerd GElias", "Carmel TChan", "ZhengMiao", "ZhenCheng", "AbhijitDe", "Sanjiv SGambhir"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3213"}

It has been identified that carcinomas with high expression levels of EGFR are more resistant to radiotherapy. Therefore, inhibiting nuclear translocation of EGFR to increase the radiosensitivity of malignant cells expressing EGFR offers the potential for increasing the therapeutic index of radiotherapy. The purpose of the present study was to quantify and to compare the radiosensitizing properties of the well-known anti-EGFR antibodies, cetuximab and nimotuzumab in human epidermoid A431 overexpressing EGFR cells. Cells were treated with two concentrations of the antibodies and then irradiated with a single dose of 4 Gy. The results indicated that the two antibodies induced radiosensitization increasing the percentage of dead/dying cells and the yield of \u03b3-H2AX foci 24 h after irradiation. Whereas cetuximab exhibited a significant increase in radiosensitization at the highest concentration, the effects of nimotuzumab were more modest. A correlation between \u03b3-H2AX foci signals and dead/dying cells was observed. The disparity in modulation of radiation-induced DNA damage by the two antibodies could be associated with the level of their respective intrinsic cytotoxic properties.

This is an important reason why various anti- cancer therapies often fail to completely control tumors, although they kill and eliminate the bulk of cancer cells. In this study, we determined whether or not adenine nucleotide translocator-2 (ANT2) suppression could also be effective in inducing cell death of breast cancer stem-like cells. A sub-population (SP; CD44+/ CD24-) of breast cancer cells has been reported to have stem/progenitor cell properties. We utilized the adeno- ANT2 shRNA virus to inhibit ANT2 expression and then observed the treatment effect in a SP of breast cancer cell line. In this study, MCF7, MDA-MB-231 cells, and breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) mesenchymally-transdifferentiated through E-cadherin knockdown were used. ANT2 expression was high in both stem-like cells and non-stem-like cells of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and was induced and up-regulated by mesenchymal transdifferentiation in MCF10A cells (MCF10A(EMT)). Knockdown of ANT2 by adeno-shRNA virus efficiently induced apoptotic cell death in the stem-like cells of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and MCF10A(EMT). Stem-like cells of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, and MCF10A(EMT) cells exhibited increased drug (doxorubicin) resistance, and expressed a multi-drug resistant related molecule, ABCG2, at a high level. Adeno-ANT2 shRNA virus markedly sensitized the stem-like cells of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, and the MCF10A(EMT) cells to doxorubicin, which was accompanied by down-regulation of ABCG2.

The purpose of this study was to assess non-compliance in the first 2.5 years of extended adjuvant therapy. Non-compliance was defined as early discontinuation of LET for all reasons, excluding death or recurrence.\nAt 2.5 years, 1215 patients were included in the analysis. Overall non-compliance probability was 18.4%, of which 85.1% discontinued due to toxicities. Analyses showed that patients with prior sequential therapy were less likely to discontinue treatment than when treated with AI or TAM upfront (logrank p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Longer treatment-free intervals also predicted more non-compliance (logrank p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Age was not predictive of non-compliance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.571).

{"title": "Twist contributes to hormone resistance in breast cancer by downregulating estrogen receptor-\u03b1.", "abstract": "The role of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER) in breast cancer development, and as a primary clinical marker for breast cancer prognosis, has been well documented. In this study, we identified the oncogenic protein, TWIST1 (Twist), which is overexpressed in high-grade breast cancers, as a potential negative regulator of ER expression. Functional characterization of ER regulation by Twist was performed using Twist low (MCF-7, T-47D) and Twist high (Hs 578T, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7/Twist) expressing cell lines. All Twist high expressing cell lines exhibited low ER transcript and protein levels. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter assays, we demonstrated that Twist could directly bind to E-boxes in the ER promoter and significantly downregulate ER promoter activity in vitro. Functionally, Twist overexpression caused estrogen-independent proliferation of breast cells, and promoted hormone resistance to the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen and selective estrogen receptor down-regulator fulvestrant. Importantly, this effect was reversible on downregulating Twist. In addition, orthotopic tumors generated in mice using MCF-7/Twist cells were resistant to tamoxifen. These tumors had high vascular volume and permeability surface area, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mechanistically, Twist recruited DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) to the ER promoter, leading to a significantly higher degree of ER promoter methylation compared with parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Twist interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the ER promoter, causing histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation, further reducing ER transcript levels. Functional re-expression of ER was achieved using the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, and the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid. Finally, an inverse relationship was observed between Twist and ER expression in human breast tumors. In summary, the regulation of ER by Twist could be an underlying mechanism for the loss of ER activity observed in breast tumors, and may contribute to the generation of hormone-resistant, ER-negative breast cancer.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2011-11-08", "authors": ["FVesuna", "ALisok", "BKimble", "JDomek", "YKato", "Pvan der Groep", "DArtemov", "JKowalski", "HCarraway", "Pvan Diest", "VRaman"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2011.483"}

At 2 weeks, (125)I uptake in the tumor treated with 150\u2009\u03bcg of antibody was as low as 44.3% of that in the controls. CD31 staining and RT-PCR assays showed that blood vessel formation and expression of the hNIS gene were reduced with increased treatment doses. This study demonstrated the feasibility of molecular imaging and the therapeutic efficacy of developing therapeutic antibody anti-hVEGFR2 using a gamma imaging system in hNIS gene-transfected tumor xenograft mice.", "journal": "Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals", "date": "2011-10-19", "authors": ["Su-JinCheong", "Chang-MoonLee", "DooRyeJang", "Eun-MiKim", "Min-HeeJeong", "Tai-BoongUhm", "Weon-SupLee", "Hwan-JeongJeong", "Dong WookKim", "Seok TaeLim", "Myung-HeeSohn"], "doi": "10.1089/cbr.2011.0996"}

In addition to enhancing the cytotoxic effect of DNA-damaging chemotherapies, we have previously shown that AG014699 is vasoactive, thereby having the potential to improve drug biodistribution. The effectiveness of the clinical agent doxorubicin is confounded both by poor tumor penetration and cardiotoxicity elicited via PARP hyperactivation. In this study, we analyzed the impact of AG014699 on doxorubicin tolerance and response in breast (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal (SW620, LoVo) tumor models in vitro and in vivo. As anticipated, AG014699 did not potentiate the response to doxorubicin in vitro. In vivo, AG014699 did not influence the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin; however, it did ameliorate cardiotoxicity. Both toxicity and extent of amelioration were more pronounced in male than in female mice. AG014699 improved vessel perfusion in both MDA-MB-231 and SW620 tumors; however, this neither led to improved tumor-accumulation of doxorubicin nor enhanced therapeutic response. In contrast, when combined with radiotherapy, AG014699 significantly enhanced response both in vitro and in vivo. Real-time assessment of tumor vessel function and companion histologic studies indicate that doxorubicin causes a profound antivascular effect that counters the positive effect of AG014699 on perfusion. These data indicate that although AG014699 can enhance response to some chemotherapeutic drugs via improved delivery, this does not apply to doxorubicin.

We wished to determine whether the high levels of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) within the tumor vasculature could be leveraged for intracellular delivery of therapeutically significant doses of scVEGF/(177)Lu, a novel radiopharmaceutical based on a recombinant single-chain (sc) derivative of VEGF, in orthotopic breast cancer models.\nscVEGF-PEG (polyethylene gycol)-DOTA conjugates containing 2.0-, 3.4-, or 5.0-kDa PEG linkers site-specifically conjugated to a cysteine-containing tag (Cys-tag) in scVEGF were radiolabeled with (177)Lu (scVEGF/(177)Lu) for in vivo studies. Human MDA231luc and mouse 4T1luc cell lines were injected orthotopically to establish breast carcinoma tumors in immunodeficient and immunocompetent hosts, respectively. The effects of scVEGF/(177)Lu were defined by analysis of changes in tumor growth and immunohistochemical staining for the endothelial markers CD31 and VEGFR-2 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining for intratumoral apoptosis.\nBiodistribution assays and dosimetric calculations established that scVEGF/(177)Lu with a 3.4-kDa PEG linker delivered the highest dose of radiation to tumors (69.9 cGy/MBq/g of tissue) and the lowest dose to the kidneys (33.3 cGy/MBq/organ). Total doses below 40 MBq/mouse of scVEGF/(177)Lu did not affect renal function, and 3 divided doses of 6.3 MBq/mouse or a bolus dose of 18.9 MBq/mouse induced only transient lymphopenia and weight loss (<10% baseline weight). In mice with orthotopic mammary breast carcinoma, intravenous injections of well-tolerated bolus and fractionated doses of scVEGF/(177)Lu in the range from 6.3 to 18.9 MBq/mouse (25-76 MBq/m(2)) resulted in dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors at 4-5 wk after single injections of scVEGF/(177)Lu indicated dose-dependent regression of tumor vasculature and widespread intratumoral apoptosis. A single dose of 7.4 MBq/mouse of scVEGF/(177)Lu given before a course of bevacizumab or sunitinib treatment enhanced the antiangiogenic effects of both drugs.\nSelective targeting of VEGFR in tumor vasculature with well-tolerated doses of scVEGF/(177)Lu is effective in orthotopic breast cancer models.

The current studies indicate that the combination of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with radiation appears to kill p53 wild-type, estrogen receptor-positive ZR-75-1 breast tumor cells through autophagy. Minimal apoptosis was observed based on cell morphology by DAPI and TUNEL staining, annexin/PI analysis, caspase-3, and PARP cleavage as well as cell cycle analysis. Induction of autophagy was indicated by increased acridine orange staining, RFP-LC3 redistribution, and detection of autophagic vesicles by electron microscopy, while autophagic flux was monitored based on p62 degradation. The autophagy inhibitors, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, as well as genetic suppression of the autophagic signaling proteins Atg5 or Atg 7 attenuated the impact of the combination treatment of 1,25 D3 with radiation. In contrast to autophagy mediating the effects of the combination treatment, the autophagy induced by radiation alone was apparently cytoprotective in that either pharmacological or genetic inhibition increased sensitivity to radiation. These studies support the potential utility of vitamin D for improving the impact of radiation for breast cancer therapy, support the feasibility of combining chloroquine with radiation for the treatment of breast cancer, and demonstrate the existence of an \"autophagic switch\" from cytoprotective autophagy with radiation alone to cytotoxic autophagy with the 1,25 D3-radiation combination.", "journal": "Hormones & cancer", "date": "2011-09-03", "authors": ["Eden NWilson", "Molly LBristol", "XuDi", "William AMaltese", "KristenKoterba", "Matthew JBeckman", "David AGewirtz"], "doi": "10.1007/s12672-011-0081-7\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1610\n10.1023/B:CANC.0000031769.14728.bc\n10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0283:SARIAO]2.0.CO;2\n10.2307/3580143\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0316\n10.1007/s002800000251\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.12.013\n10.1126/science.1099993\n10.1091/mbc.E07-10-1092\n10.1038/nrm2239\n10.1097/01.cad.0000171514.50310.85\n10.1016/S0070-2153(06)78006-1\n10.1016/j.radonc.2009.05.022\n10.1002/ijc.24402\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0562\n10.1074/jbc.M607094200\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0802\n10.1016/j.ijrobp.2007.08.034\n10.1038/sj.onc.1201329\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0966\n10.2174/138161210789941801\n10.1074/jbc.M413934200\n10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.07.014\n10.1016/S0076-6879(08)01415-8\n10.1083/jcb.151.2.263\n10.1074/jbc.M702824200\n10.4161/auto.6.6.12510\n10.1242/jcs.026005\n10.1038/nprot.2009.191\n10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00832.x\n10.1242/jcs.01620\n10.1080/09553000500168549\n10.1667/RR3280\n10.1038/sj.cdd.4402200\n10.4161/auto.6.2.11062\n10.1038/onc.2010.74\n10.4161/cc.5.4.2467\n10.4161/cc.10.12.15620\n10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.034\n10.1083/jcb.119.3.493\n10.1073/pnas.92.20.9363"}

Craniospinal radiotherapy is a standard of care, followed by a 12mo regimen of multi-agent chemotherapy.

Long-term prognosis is worst for these youngest children and more effective treatment strategies with a better therapeutic index are needed.

In the current study, we have identified new mechanisms of action by which VMY-1-103 affected cellular proliferation in medulloblastoma cells. VMY-1-103, but not purvalanol B, significantly decreased the proportion of cells in S phase and increased the proportion of cells in G(2)/M. VMY-1-103 increased the sub G(1) fraction of apoptotic cells, induced PARP and caspase-3 cleavage and increased the levels of the Death Receptors DR4 and DR5, Bax and Bad while decreasing the number of viable cells, all supporting apoptosis as a mechanism of cell death. p21(CIP1/WAF1) levels were greatly suppressed. Importantly, we found that while both VMY and flavopiridol inhibited intracellular CDK1 catalytic activity, VMY-1-103 was unique in its ability to severely disrupt the mitotic spindle apparatus significantly delaying metaphase and disrupting mitosis.

{"title": "Involvement of Akt and mTOR in chemotherapeutic- and hormonal-based drug resistance and response to radiation in breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "Elucidating the response of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic and hormonal based drugs and radiation is clearly important as these are common treatment approaches. Signaling cascades often involved in chemo-, hormonal- and radiation resistance are the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and p53 pathways. In the following studies we have examined the effects of activation of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascade in the response of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic- and hormonal-based drugs and radiation. Activation of Akt by introduction of conditionally-activated Akt-1 gene could result in resistance to chemotherapeutic and hormonal based drugs as well as radiation. We have determined that chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin or the hormone based drug tamoxifen, both used to treat breast cancer, resulted in the activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway which is often associated with a pro-proliferative, anti-apoptotic response. In drug sensitive MCF-7 cells which have wild-type p53; ERK, p53 and downstream p21 (Cip-1 ) were induced upon exposure to doxorubicin.

Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) is induced during hypoxia and is involved in multiple cellular pathways involved in cell survival. Here, we investigated the role of TRIB3 in breast cancer.\nTRIB3 mRNA expression was measured in breast tumor tissue from 247 patients and correlated with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcome. Furthermore, we studied TRIB3 expression regulation in cell lines, xenografts tissues and human breast cancer material using Reverse transcriptase, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated TRIB3 knockdown on hypoxia tolerance was assessed.\nBreast cancer patients with low, intermediate or high TRIB3 expression exhibited a mean disease free survival (DFS) of 80 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74 to 86), 74 (CI = 67 to 81), and 63 (CI = 55 to 71) months respectively (P = .002, Mantel-Cox log-rank). The prognostic value of TRIB3 was limited to those patients that had received radiotherapy as part of their primary treatment (n = 179, P = .005) and remained statistically significant after correction for other clinicopathological parameters (DFS, Hazard Ratio = 1.90, CI = 1.17 to 3.08, P = .009). In breast cell lines TRIB3 expression was induced by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in an hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) independent manner. TRIB3 induction after hypoxia did not increase with decreasing oxygen levels. In breast tumor xenografts and human breast cancer tissues TRIB3 co-localized with the hypoxic cell marker pimonidazole. The induction of TRIB3 by hypoxia was shown to be regulated via the PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathway of the unfolded protein response and knockdown of TRIB3 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hypoxia sensitivity.\nTRIB3 is independently associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, possibly through its association with tumor cell hypoxia.", "journal": "Breast cancer research : BCR", "date": "2011-08-26", "authors": ["MarloesWennemers", "JohanBussink", "BlancaScheijen", "Iris DNagtegaal", "Hanneke W Mvan Laarhoven", "James ARaleigh", "Mahesh AVaria", "Joop J T MHeuvel", "Kasper MRouschop", "Fred C G JSweep", "Paul NSpan"], "doi": "10.1186/bcr2934\n10.1038/nrc704\n10.1016/j.ejca.2008.09.025\n10.1038/nrc2540\n10.1093/jnci/93.4.309\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-2690\n10.1038/onc.2008.100\n10.2174/156652409788167131\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600596\n10.1126/science.1079817\n10.1074/jbc.M407732200\n10.1016/j.cellsig.2005.08.002\n10.1038/sj.onc.1206367\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.02.149\n10.1172/JCI37948\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6605361\n10.1016/j.bbagen.2006.09.025\n10.1371/journal.pmed.0030047\n10.1002/ijc.23479\n10.1038/sj.bjc.6601122\n10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.12.006\n10.1093/jnci/dji237\n10.1200/JCO.2004.01.072\n10.1016/S0360-3016(00)01505-4\n10.1038/bjc.1995.429\n10.1016/S0360-3016(01)02605-0\n10.1172/JCI40027\n10.1006/mvre.1995.1048\n10.1038/227680a0\n10.1016/j.molonc.2008.03.006\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80862-4\n10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80861-2\n10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00502-9\n10.1248/bpb.33.1112\n10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.161\n10.1038/nm1044\n10.2337/diabetes.54.9.2807\n10.4161/cbt.4.10.2205\n10.1152/ajpendo.00117.2006\n10.1038/sj.emboj.7600777\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1606\n10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-06-0150\n10.1016/j.radonc.2007.04.031"}

Initially, 60 tumours (n=6, each subgroup) were randomised into five groups: (1) RF alone, (2) intravenous (IV) liposomal quercetin alone (1 mg/kg), (3) IV liposomal quercetin followed 24 h later with RF, (4) RF followed 15 min later by IV liposomal doxorubicin (8 mg/kg), (5) IV liposomal quercetin 24 h before RF followed by IV liposomal doxorubicin 15 min post-ablation. Animals were sacrificed 4 or 24 h post-treatment and gross coagulation diameters were compared. Next, immunohistochemistry staining was performed for Hsp70 and cleaved caspase-3 expression.

We previously identified a subpopulation of cells in human breast cancer cell lines that demonstrate high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and high expression of CD44. These ALDH(hi)CD44(+) cells displayed enhanced metastatic behavior in vitro and in vivo relative to ALDH(low)CD44(-) cells. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that ALDH(hi)CD44(+) breast cancer cells are more resistant to standard cancer therapy, and that inhibiting ALDH activity through all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or the specific ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) sensitizes these cells to treatment.

However, improvements in the therapeutic ratio for several disease sites are sorely needed, leading us to assess molecularly targeted therapeutics as radiosensitizers. The aim of this study was to assess the wee1 kinase inhibitor, MK-1775, for its ability to radiosensitize human tumor cells.\nHuman tumor cells derived from lung, breast, and prostate cancers were tested for radiosensitization by MK-1775 using clonogenic survival assays. Both p53 wild-type and p53-defective lines were included. The ability of MK-1775 to abrogate the radiation-induced G\u2082 block, thereby allowing cells harboring DNA lesions to prematurely progress into mitosis, was determined using flow cytometry and detection of \u03b3-H2AX foci. The in vivo efficacy of the combination of MK-1775 and radiation was assessed by tumor growth delay experiments using a human lung cancer cell line growing as a xenograft tumor in nude mice.\nClonogenic survival analyses indicated that nanomolar concentrations of MK-1775 radiosensitized p53-defective human lung, breast, and prostate cancer cells but not similar lines with wild-type p53. Consistent with its ability to radiosensitize, MK-1775 abrogated the radiation-induced G\u2082 block in p53-defective cells but not in p53 wild-type lines. MK-1775 also significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of radiation in vivo as shown in tumor growth delay studies, again for p53-defective tumors.\nThese results indicate that p53-defective human tumor cells are significantly radiosensitized by the potent and selective wee1 kinase inhibitor, MK-1775, in both the in vitro and in vivo settings.

Participants randomized to the exercise group will undertake a 12-month gym-based exercise program, 3 times per week involving resistance and impact training. Participants in the control group will be advised on the benefits of exercise for preventing osteoporosis, but not prescribed exercise. Both groups will receive vitamin D and calcium supplements. The primary outcome will be total hip bone mineral density measured via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

{"title": "WEE1 kinase targeting combined with DNA-damaging cancer therapy catalyzes mitotic catastrophe.", "abstract": "WEE1 kinase is a key molecule in maintaining G\u2082-cell-cycle checkpoint arrest for premitotic DNA repair. Whereas normal cells repair damaged DNA during G\u2081-arrest, cancer cells often have a deficient G\u2081-arrest and largely depend on G\u2082-arrest. The molecular switch for the G\u2082-M transition is held by WEE1 and is pushed forward by CDC25. WEE1 is overexpressed in various cancer types, including glioblastoma and breast cancer. Preclinical studies with cancer cell lines and animal models showed decreased cancer cell viability, reduced tumor burden, and improved survival after WEE1 inhibition by siRNA or small molecule inhibitors, which is enhanced by combination with conventional DNA-damaging therapy, such as radiotherapy and/or cytostatics. Mitotic catastrophe results from premature entry into mitosis with unrepaired lethal DNA damage. As such, cancer cells become sensitized to conventional therapy by WEE1 inhibition, in particular those with insufficient G\u2081-arrest due to deficient p53 signaling, like glioblastoma cells. One WEE1 inhibitor has now reached clinical phase I studies. Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of hematologic events, nausea and/or vomiting, and fatigue. The combination of DNA-damaging cancer therapy with WEE1 inhibition seems to be a rational approach to push cancer cells in mitotic catastrophe. Its safety and efficacy are being evaluated in clinical studies.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2011-05-13", "authors": ["Philip CDe Witt Hamer", "Shahryar EMir", "DavidNoske", "Cornelis J FVan Noorden", "TomW\u00fcrdinger"], "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2537"}
{"title": "Restoring p53 active conformation by zinc increases the response of mutant p53 tumor cells to anticancer drugs.", "abstract": "Absence of p53 expression or expression of mutant p53 (mtp53) are common in human cancers and are associated with increased cancer resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Therefore, significant efforts towards pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway. We previously reported that, in HIPK2 knockdown background, p53 undergoes misfolding with inhibition of DNA binding and transcriptional activities that correlate with increased chemoresistance, and that zinc rescues wild-type p53 activity. Zinc has a crucial role in the biology of p53, in that p53 binds to DNA through a structurally complex domain stabilized by zinc atom. In this study, we explored the role of zinc in p53 reactivation in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells. We found that zinc re-established chemosensitivity in breast cancer SKBR3 (expressing R175H mutation) and glioblastoma U373MG (expressing R273H mutation) cell lines. Biochemical studies showed that zinc partly induced the transition of mutant p53 protein (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb240 antibody for mutant conformation) into a functional conformation (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb1620 antibody for wild-type conformation). Zinc-mediated p53 reactivation also reduced the mtp53/p73 interaction restoring both wtp53 and p73 binding to target gene promoters by ChIP assay with in vivo induction of wtp53 target gene expression, which rendered mutant p53 cells more prone to drug killing in vitro. Finally, zinc administration in U373MG tumor xenografts increased drug-induced tumor regression in vivo, which correlated with increased wild-type p53 protein conformation. These results show that the use of zinc might restore drug sensitivity and inhibit tumor growth by reactivating mutant p53.", "journal": "Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)", "date": "2011-04-22", "authors": ["RosaPuca", "LaviniaNardinocchi", "ManuelaPorru", "Amos JSimon", "GideonRechavi", "CarloLeonetti", "DavidGivol", "GabriellaD'Orazi"], "doi": "10.4161/cc.10.10.15642"}

High doses induce significant anticancer effects, but conversely, physiologic and pathologic levels of TNF-\u03b1 may be involved in cancer promotion, tumor growth, and metastasis. Infliximab is a chimeric murine monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to soluble and membrane TNF-\u03b1 and inhibits binding of TNF-\u03b1 to its receptors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of infliximab, a TNF-\u03b1 antagonist, on breast cancer aggressiveness and bone metastases. Infliximab greatly reduced cell motility and bone metastases in a metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. The mechanism of bone metastasis inhibition involved decreased expression of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and increased expression of decorin, which is the prototype of an expanding family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans. These results suggest a novel role for TNF-\u03b1 inhibition in the reduction or prevention of bone metastases in this breast cancer model.

We thus try to explore the therapeutic effects of mTOR inhibitors on brain metastasis models. We examined the effects of different dose of mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, Temsirolimus-CCI-779) on cell invasion in two brain metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231-BR and CN34-BrM2). Antibody microarray and immunoblotting were applied to detect signaling pathways underlying the dose differential drug effects. The in vivo effects of single drug (CCI-779), and drug combination of CCI-779 with SL327 (a brain penetrant MEK inhibitor) to eliminate the unfavorable activation of MAPK pathway were evaluated in MDA-MB231-BR brain metastases xenograft mice. The two mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and CCI-779, inhibited the invasion of brain metastatic cells only at a moderate concentration level, which was lost at higher concentrations secondary to activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 and SL327 restored the anti-invasion effects of mTOR inhibition in vitro. In vivo, a significant decrease was noted in the average number of micro and large metastatic lesions as well as the whole brain GFP expression in the CCI-779 1 mg/kg/day treated group compared with that in the vehicle group (P < 0.05). However, 10 mg/kg CCI-779 treatment did not show significant anti-metastasis effect on the animal model. High-dose CCI-779 eliciting the ERK MAPK activation in the brain metastatic lesion was corroborated. Combined with the brain penetrant MEK inhibitor SL327, high-dose CCI-779 significantly reduces the brain metastasis, and the combination treatment prohibited perivascular invasion of tumor cells and inhibits tumor angiogenesis in vivo.

The median survival for untreated patients is 1 to 2 months, which may be extended to 6 months with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The growth and survival of metastasis depend on the interaction of tumor cells with host factors in the organ microenvironment. Brain metastases are surrounded and infiltrated by activated astrocytes and are highly resistant to chemotherapy. We report here that coculture of human breast cancer cells or lung cancer cells with murine astrocytes (but not murine fibroblasts) led to the up-regulation of survival genes, including GSTA5, BCL2L1, and TWIST1, in the tumor cells. The degree of up-regulation directly correlated with increased resistance to all tested chemotherapeutic agents. We further show that the up-regulation of the survival genes and consequent resistance are dependent on the direct contact between the astrocytes and tumor cells through gap junctions and are therefore transient. Knocking down these genes with specific small interfering RNA rendered the tumor cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. These data clearly demonstrate that host cells in the microenvironment influence the biologic behavior of tumor cells and reinforce the contention that the organ microenvironment must be taken into consideration during the design of therapy.", "journal": "Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)", "date": "2011-03-11", "authors": ["Sun-JinKim", "Jang-SeongKim", "Eun SungPark", "Ju-SeogLee", "QingtangLin", "Robert RLangley", "MarvaMaya", "JunqinHe", "Seung-WookKim", "ZhangWeihua", "KrishnakumarBalasubramanian", "DominicFan", "Gordon BMills", "Mien-ChieHung", "Isaiah JFidler"], "doi": "10.1593/neo.11112"}

In this study, we investigated the effect of an ER agonist (17\u03b2-estradiol, E(2)) or antagonist [trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) or raloxifene (RAL)] treatment on the regulation of NIS gene expression and iodide uptake in an ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer (MCF-7) model.\nNIS functional activity was measured in vitro by (125)I uptake assay after incubation with E(2) (from 10(-15) to 10(-5) M), TOT (from 5\u00d710(-8) to 5\u00d710(-6) M), or RAL (from 5\u00d710(-8) to 5\u00d710(-6) M) in the presence or absence of atRA (10(-7) M).

Two of the most at risk female minority groups are American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and Latinas.

Breast cancer screening rates for both minority groups are near or at the lowest among all racial/ethnic groups. As with other health screening behaviors, women may intend to get a mammogram but their intentions may not result in initiation or follow through of the examination process. An accumulating body of research, however, demonstrates the efficacy of developing 'implementation intentions' that define when, where, and how a specific behavior will be performed. The formulation of intended steps in addition to addressing potential barriers to test completion can increase a person's self-efficacy, operationalize and strengthen their intention to act, and close gaps between behavioral intention and completion.

{"title": "An assessment of American Indian women's mammography experiences.", "abstract": "Mortality from breast cancer has increased among American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) women. Despite this alarming reality, AI/AN women have some of the lowest breast cancer screening rates. Only 37% of eligible AI/AN women report a mammogram within the last year and 52% report a mammogram within the last two years compared to 57% and 72% for White women. The experiences and satisfaction surrounding mammography for AI/AN women likely are different from that of women of other racial/ethnic groups, due to cultural differences and limited access to Indian Health Service sponsored mammography units. The overall goals of this study are to identify and understand the mammography experiences and experiential elements that relate to satisfaction or dissatisfaction with mammography services in an AI/AN population and to develop a culturally-tailored AI/AN mammography satisfaction survey.\nThe three project aims that will be used to guide this work are: 1) To compare the mammography experiences and satisfaction with mammography services of Native American/Alaska Native women with that of Non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and Black women, 2) To develop and validate the psychometric properties of an American Indian Mammography Survey, and 3) To assess variation among AI/AN women's assessments of their mammography experiences and mammography service satisfaction. Evaluations of racial/ethnic differences in mammography patient satisfaction have received little study, particularly among AI/AN women. As such, qualitative study is uniquely suited for an initial examination of their experiences because it will allow for a rich and in-depth identification and exploration of satisfaction elements.\nThis formative research is an essential step in the development of a validated and culturally tailored AI/AN mammography satisfaction assessment. Results from this project will provide a springboard from which a maximally effective breast cancer screening program to benefit AI/AN population will be developed and tested in an effort to alter the current breast cancer-related morbidity and mortality trajectory among AI/AN women.", "journal": "BMC women's health", "date": "2010-12-17", "authors": ["Kimberly KEngelman", "Christine MDaley", "Byron JGajewski", "FlorenceNdikum-Moffor", "BabalolaFaseru", "StacyBraiuca", "StephanieJoseph", "Edward FEllerbeck", "K AllenGreiner"], "doi": "10.1186/1472-6874-10-34\n10.1007/BF01806006\n10.1093/aje/152.5.432\n10.1111/j.1525-1497.2000.01339.x\n10.1002/1097-0142(19920101)69:1<165::AID-CNCR2820690128>3.0.CO;2-F\n10.1002/cncr.20671\n10.1006/pmed.1999.0564\n10.1353/hpu.2004.0048\n10.1007/s10549-004-1476-8\n10.1016/j.ypmed.2004.05.006\n10.1046/j.1532-5415.2002.50009.x\n10.1001/jama.264.1.54\n10.1111/j.1748-0361.1996.tb00817.x\n10.1016/0091-7435(92)90050-R\n10.1016/0091-7435(90)90028-I\n10.1007/BF02602407\n10.2105/AJPH.84.1.62\n10.1177/089826439700900304\n10.1080/13557858.1996.9961790\n10.1097/00002820-199302000-00001\n10.4065/73.4.301\n10.1111/j.1525-1497.2001.00228.x\n10.2105/AJPH.84.1.50\n10.1300/J013v26n01_04\n10.1001/archinte.155.4.421\n10.1146/annurev.publhealth.22.1.213\n10.1097/00005650-198206000-00006\n10.1016/0149-7189(83)90009-5\n10.1136/bmj.305.6851.443\n10.1007/BF01833519\n10.1016/S1076-6332(98)80261-4\n10.1093/fampra/13.1.67\n10.1097/00005650-199707000-00006\n10.1136/qshc.7.3.136\n10.1111/j.1753-6405.1993.tb00116.x\n10.1006/pmed.1999.0497\n10.1016/0277-5379(91)90126-X\n10.1001/jama.284.4.478\n10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.255\n10.1007/s10900-006-9019-3\n10.1367/A04-107R.1\n10.1136/adc.87.6.534\n10.2196/jmir.7.5.e50\n10.1300/J115v23n04_06\n10.2196/jmir.5.3.e17\n10.1177/1359105303008001426\n10.1002/(SICI)1098-240X(199706)20:3<269::AID-NUR9>3.0.CO;2-G\n10.1002/nur.20147\n10.1016/0895-4356(92)90194-R\n10.1016/S0197-2456(05)80019-4\n10.1007/BF02310555"}
{"title": "A support vector machine (SVM) for predicting preferred treatment position in radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer.", "abstract": "NYU 05-181 protocol compared the CT simulation in both supine and prone positions for 400 patients with breast cancer (200 left-breast and 200 right-breast) to identify which setup is better at sparing heart and lung involvement in the treatment process. The results demonstrated that all right-breast patients benefited from the prone treatment position, while for left-breast patients, 85% were better treated prone and 15% were better treated supine. Using the clinical data collected from this protocol, the authors aimed at developing an automated tool capable of identifying which of the left-breast cancer patients are better treated supine without obtaining a second CT scan in the supine position.\nProne CT scans from 198 of the 200 left-breast cancer patients enrolled in NYU 05-181 protocol were deidentified and exported to a dedicated research planning workstation. Three-dimensional geometric features of the organs at risk and tumor bed were extracted. A two-stage classifier was used to classify patients into the prone class or the supine class. In the first stage, the authors use simple thresholding to divide the patients into two groups based on their in-field heart volume. For patients with in-field heart volume < or = 0.1 cc, the prone position was chosen as the preferred treatment position. Patients with in-field heart volume > 0.1 cc will be further classified in the second stage by a weighted support vector machine (SVM). The weight parameters of the SVM were adjusted to maximize the specificity [true-supine/(true-supine+false-prone)] at the cost of lowering but still maintaining reasonable sensitivity [true-prone/(true-prone+false-supine)]. The authors used K-fold cross validations to test the performance of the SVM classifier. A feature selection algorithm was also used to identify features that give the best classification performance.\nAfter the first stage, 49 of the 198 left-breast cancer patients were found to have > 0.1 cc of in-field heart volume. The three geometric features of heart orientation, distance between heart and tumor, and in-field lung were selected by the feature selection algorithm in the second stage of the two-stage classifier to give the best predefined weighted accuracy. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method were found to be 90.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Using two-stage classification, the authors reduced the proportion of prone-treated patients that need a second supine CT scan down to 16.3/170 or 9.6%, as compared to 21/170 or 12.4% when the authors use only the first stage (thresholding) for classification.\nThe authors' study showed that a feature-based classifier is feasible for predicting the preferred treatment position, based on features extracted from prone CT scans. The two-stage classifier achieved very high specificity at an acceptable expense of sensitivity.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2010-11-26", "authors": ["XuanZhao", "Edward KWong", "YaoWang", "StellaLymberis", "BixiuWen", "SilviaFormenti", "JenghwaChang"], "doi": "10.1118/1.3483264"}

Using both syngeneic mouse and human xenograft models of triple-negative breast cancer, we have demonstrated that a subpopulation enriched in cancer stem cells was more resistant to treatment with 6 gray of ionizing radiation than the bulk of the tumor cells, and accordingly their relative proportion increased 48 to 72 hours after ionizing radiation treatment. In contrast, we achieved a larger reduction in tumor size without a concomitant increase in the percentage of cancer stem cells by treating with local hyperthermia for 20 minutes at 42\u00b0C after ionizing radiation using intravenously administered, optically activated gold nanoshells. Forty-eight hours after treatment, cells derived from the tumors treated with ionizing radiation plus hyperthermia exhibited both a marked decrease in tumorigenicity and a more differentiated phenotype than mock- and ionizing radiation-treated tumors. Thus, we have confirmed that these cancer stem cells are responsible for accelerated repopulation in vivo and demonstrated that hyperthermia sensitizes this cell population to radiation treatment.

{"title": "Therapeutic strategies and mechanisms of tumorigenesis of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.", "abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase HER2 is overexpressed in approximately 25% of breast cancers. HER2 acts as a signal amplifier for its siblings, namely three different transmembrane receptors that collectively bind with 11 distinct growth factors of the EGF family. Thus, overexpression of HER2 confers aggressive invasive growth in preclinical models and in patients. Specific therapies targeting HER2 include monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as heat shock protein and sheddase inhibitors. Two of these drugs have shown impressive - yet mostly transient - efficacy in patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer. We highlight the biological roles of HER2 in breast cancer progression, and overview the available therapeutic armamentarium directed against this receptor-kinase molecule.

However, 17-AAG treatment often results in inhibition of tumor growth rather than shrinkage, making detection of response a challenge. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) are noninvasive imaging methods than can be used to monitor metabolic biomarkers of drug-target modulation. This study set out to examine the MRS-detectable metabolic consequences of Hsp90 inhibition in a breast cancer model.\nMCF-7 breast cancer cells were investigated, and MRS studies were performed both on live cells and on cell extracts. (31)P and (1)H MRS were used to determine total cellular metabolite concentrations and (13)C MRS was used to probe the metabolism of [1,2-(13)C]-choline. To explain the MRS metabolic findings, microarray and RT-PCR were used to analyze gene expression, and in vitro activity assays were performed to determine changes in enzymatic activity following 17-AAG treatment.\nTreatment of MCF-7 cells with 17-AAG for 48 hours caused a significant increase in intracellular levels of choline (to 266 \u00b1 18% of control, P = 0.05) and phosphocholine (PC; to 181 \u00b1 10% of control, P = 0.001) associated with an increase in expression of choline transporter SLC44A1 and an elevation in the de novo synthesis of PC. We also detected an increase in intracellular levels of glycerophosphocholine (GPC; to 176 \u00b1 38% of control, P = 0.03) associated with an increase in PLA2 expression and activity.\nThis study determined that in the MCF-7 breast cancer model inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG results in a significant MRS-detectable increase in choline, PC and GPC, which is likely due to an increase in choline transport into the cell and phospholipase activation. (1)H MRSI can be used in the clinical setting to detect levels of total choline-containing metabolite (t-Cho, composed of intracellular choline, PC and GPC).

{"title": "Ionizing radiation activates the Nrf2 antioxidant response.", "abstract": "The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) binds the antioxidant DNA response element (ARE) to activate important cellular cytoprotective defense systems. Recently several types of cancers have been shown to overexpress Nrf2, but its role in the cellular response to radiation therapy has yet to be fully determined. In this study, we report that single doses of ionizing radiation from 2 to 8 Gy activate ARE-dependent transcription in breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, but only after a delay of five days. Clinically relevant daily dose fractions of radiation also increased ARE-dependent transcription, but again only after five days. Downstream activation of Nrf2-ARE-dependent gene and protein markers, such as heme oxygenase-1, occurred, whereas Nrf2-deficient fibroblasts were incapable of these responses. Compared with wild-type fibroblasts, Nrf2-deficient fibroblasts had relatively high basal levels of reactive oxygen species that increased greatly five days after radiation exposure. Further, in vitro clonogenic survival assays and in vivo sublethal whole body irradiation tests showed that Nrf2 deletion increased radiation sensitivity, whereas Nrf2-inducing drugs did not increase radioresistance. Our results indicate that the Nrf2-ARE pathway is important to maintain resistance to irradiation, but that it operates as a second-tier antioxidant adaptive response system activated by radiation only under specific circumstances, including those that may be highly relevant to tumor response during standard clinical dose-fractionated radiation therapy.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2010-10-14", "authors": ["J TysonMcDonald", "KwangheeKim", "Andrew JNorris", "ErinaVlashi", "Tiffany MPhillips", "ChannLagadec", "LorenzaDella Donna", "JosephineRatikan", "HeatherSzelag", "LynnHlatky", "William HMcBride"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-0171"}
{"title": "Reversal of skeletal effects of endocrine treatments in the Intergroup Exemestane Study.", "abstract": "The adjuvant use of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer is associated with adverse effects on bone health. We previously reported a decline in bone mineral density (BMD) following the switch from tamoxifen to exemestane in the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES). Here we report effects of endocrine treatment withdrawal on BMD, bone turnover markers (BTM) and fracture rates. 4,724 patients took part in IES, and 206 patients were included in a bone sub-study. BMD and BTM were assessed pre-randomization, during and after the end of treatment (EOT). To evaluate treatment withdrawal effects, 12- and 24-month post EOT BMD results are available for 122 and 126 patients, respectively. Similar patient numbers had BTM measured post EOT. Following treatment withdrawal, the differences in BMD observed between the two endocrine strategies were partially reversed. At 24 months from EOT, spine BMD increased by 1.53% (95%CI 0.63-2.43; p = 0.001) after stopping exemestane and fell by 1.93% (95%CI -2.91 to 0.95; p = 0.0002) following tamoxifen withdrawal. A similar pattern of changes was observed at the hip. At 2 years post EOT, BMD changes from baseline were similar with both treatment strategies. Corresponding inverse changes in BTM were seen, with an increase following tamoxifen withdrawal and a reduction after exemestane. A higher number of fractures occurred during exemestane treatment, but fracture rates were similar after treatment withdrawal. With the switch strategy used in IES, the on treatment adverse bone effects of exemestane are reversed.

To establish stable cells, SKBR3 cells were transfected with Siah1, Siah-1L and Siah1DeltaR. Siah1 function was suppressed by siRNA in MCF-7 cells. The impact of Siah1 overexpression and silencing on apoptosis, proliferation, survival, invasion ability and DNA repair was assessed in SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells, also in regards to radiation.\nSiah1 and Siah1L mRNA expression was absent in four of five breast cancer cells lines analysed. Overexpression of Siah1 and Siah1L enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in stable transfected SKBR3 cells, while Siah1DeltaR failed to show this effect. In addition, Siah1 and Siah1L significantly reduced cell clonogenic survival and proliferation. Siah1L sensitization enhancement ratio values were over 1.5 and 4.0 for clonogenic survival and proliferation, respectively, pointing to a highly cooperative and potentially synergistic fashion with radiation.

Despite recent advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the overall cure for patients with HNSCC has remained at less than 50% for many decades. Patients with recurrent and metastatic disease have a median survival of only 6-10 months. Systemic chemotherapy is the only treatment option for those patients. New treatment options are thus desperately needed to supplement, complement, or replace currently available therapies. New agents that target molecular and cellular pathways of the disease pathogenesis of HNSCC are promising candidates. One class of these new agents is angiogenesis inhibitors that have been proven effective in the treatment of advanced colorectal, breast, and non-small cell lung cancers. Similar to other solid tumors, angiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. A number of angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenin (ANG) have been shown to be significantly upregulated in HNSCC. Among them, ANG is unique in which it is a ribonuclease that regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. ANG-stimulated rRNA transcription has been shown to be a general requirement for angiogenesis induced by other angiogenic factors. ANG inhibitors have been demonstrated to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth induced not only by ANG but also by other angiogenic factors.

{"title": "Recruitment of myeloid but not endothelial precursor cells facilitates tumor regrowth after local irradiation.", "abstract": "Tumor neovascularization and growth might be promoted by the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDC), which include endothelial precursor cells and \"vascular modulatory\" myelomonocytic (CD11b+) cells. BMDCs may also drive tumor regrowth after certain chemotherapeutic and vascular disruption treatments. In this study, we evaluated the role of BMDC recruitment in breast and lung carcinoma xenograft models after local irradiation (LI). We depleted the bone marrow by including whole-body irradiation (WBI) of 6 Gy as part of a total tumor dose of 21 Gy, and compared the growth delay with the one achieved after LI of 21 Gy. In both models, the inclusion of WBI induced longer tumor growth delays. Moreover, WBI increased lung tumor control probability by LI. Exogenous delivery of BMDCs from radiation-na\u00efve donors partially abrogated the WBI effect. Myeloid BMDCs, primarily macrophages, rapidly accumulated in tumors after LI. Intratumoral expression of stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha), a chemokine that promotes tissue retention of BMDCs, was noted 2 days after LI. Conversely, treatment with an inhibitor of SDF-1alpha receptor CXCR4 (AMD3100) with LI significantly delayed tumor regrowth.

Here we present the therapeutic efficacy of a robotic radiosurgery for local control of liver metastases from solid tumors.\nPatients with tumorous lesions to the liver, not qualifying for surgery, were treated with single-session radiosurgery (24\u00a0Gy) that used robotic image-guided real-time tumor tracking. All detectable lesions had to be irradiated. In a prospective analysis, follow-up was performed by magnetic resonance imaging scanning 2\u00a0months after the treatment, and subsequently at 3-month intervals to evaluate local control. For inclusion into the radiosurgery treatment protocol, tumor volumes had to be <90 ml.\nThirty-six patients (median age, 65 years) with a total of 54 target lesions were evaluated. Single lesions were treated in 23 patients and multiple targets in 13 patients. Metastases originated from colon cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a019), ovarian cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a03), pancreatic cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a02), breast cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and others (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Four lesions were of primary liver origin (hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma). Median tumor volume was 18\u00a0ml (range, 2.2-90\u00a0ml). The median follow-up was 21.3 months. The disease of 25 patients (69.4%) showed complete or partial local response, 6 patients (16.7%) had stable lesions, and 5 patients (14%) experienced local recurrence.

{"title": "The role of targeted agents in preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer.", "abstract": "In the United States, randomized trials have established preoperative chemoradiation as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Pathologic complete response (pCR) rates occur in 10% to 16% of patients and have been shown to be correlated with both disease-free and overall survival. Therefore, recent efforts incorporating newer cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents into chemoradiotherapy regimens have reported the pCR rate to be a surrogate marker of clinical outcomes. Substitution of oral fluoropyrimidines, including capecitabine, for infusional 5-fluorouracil reportedly generated pCR rates of up to 32% in phase 2 studies, but definitive evaluation awaits results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) R-04 trial. Similarly, regimens incorporating irinotecan generated pCR rates as high as 38%, but to the authors' knowledge have not been evaluated in randomized trials. In contrast, 2 large randomized trials reported that the addition of weekly oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation led to an increase in grade 3/4 toxicity but no difference in pCR rates. Early phase trials evaluating the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody cetuximab in combination with chemoradiation reported modest pCR rates of 5% to 12%, and efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers of response including EGFR copy number, k-ras mutational status, and both serum and tumor-specific expression of EGFR ligands. Finally, incorporation of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab into chemoradiation appears to be safe and feasible, with initial studies reporting a beneficial effect on vascular normalization and correlations between circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis and pathologic response. Future efforts should include prospective studies of these agents in biomarker-defined subpopulations, as well as studies of novel agents that target angiogenesis, tumor-stromal interaction, and the cell signaling pathways implicated in colorectal cancer.", "journal": "Cancer", "date": "2010-06-22", "authors": ["Raymond CWadlow", "David PRyan"], "doi": "10.1002/cncr.25155"}
{"title": "Breast cancer cells in three-dimensional culture display an enhanced radioresponse after coordinate targeting of integrin alpha5beta1 and fibronectin.", "abstract": "Tactics to selectively enhance cancer radioresponse are of great interest. Cancer cells actively elaborate and remodel their extracellular matrix (ECM) to aid in survival and progression. Previous work has shown that beta1-integrin inhibitory antibodies can enhance the growth-inhibitory and apoptotic responses of human breast cancer cell lines to ionizing radiation, either when cells are cultured in three-dimensional laminin-rich ECM (3D lrECM) or grown as xenografts in mice. Here, we show that a specific alpha heterodimer of beta1-integrin preferentially mediates a prosurvival signal in human breast cancer cells that can be specifically targeted for therapy. 3D lrECM culture conditions were used to compare alpha-integrin heterodimer expression in malignant and nonmalignant cell lines. Under these conditions, we found that expression of alpha5beta1-integrin was upregulated in malignant cells compared with nonmalignant breast cells. Similarly, we found that normal and oncofetal splice variants of fibronectin, the primary ECM ligand of alpha5beta1-integrin, were also strikingly upregulated in malignant cell lines compared with nonmalignant acini. Cell treatment with a peptide that disrupts the interactions of alpha5beta1-integrin with fibronectin promoted apoptosis in malignant cells and further heightened the apoptotic effects of radiation. In support of these results, an analysis of gene expression array data from breast cancer patients revealed an association of high levels of alpha5-integrin expression with decreased survival.

The dose fractionation effect in radiation therapy has been known for more than a century, but it is not reported in SDT so far. In this study, the in vivo antitumor effect of the simultaneous dual-frequency ultrasound (1 MHz and 150 kHz) at low-level intensity (cumulative I(SATA) = 2.2W/cm(2); total energy density 3960J/cm(2); for 30 min sonication) in combination with the sonosensitizer of photofrin (PF) (sodium porfimer) was investigated in dose fractionation regime in a spontaneous murine model of breast adenocarcinoma in Balb/c mice. The tumor-bearing mice were divided into six groups (n = 8 to 10): Untreated groups included control and sham; experimental groups were treated with 5 mg/kg intravenous injection of PF alone, with combined PF and ultrasound for 30-min sonication in one fraction at 24 h after PF administration; with combined PF and ultrasound for 30 min sonicatin in three fraction at 18, 24 and 30 h after PF administration; and finally with combined PF and ultrasound for 30 min sonication in five fraction at 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 h after PF administration. The tumor growth delay (TGD) parameters and the percent of apoptotic index AI (%) were measured in treated and untreated groups. The results show that the TGD parameters in treatment groups with combined drug and ultrasound fractionation mode were significantly different compared with other groups (p < 0.05). Also the sonodynamic ultrasound dose fractionation in five fractions is more effective than of the three-fraction regime. The AI of the tumor tissues treated by ultrasound dose fractionation was also significantly higher in the other groups (p < 0.05), in which the AI (%) in the group treated with five fractions was higher with respect to group treated with 3 fractions (11.56 +/- 1.2; 8.7 +/- 0.87), respectively.

After IR-based manual prepositioning to rough treatment position and fixation of the mechanical arm, a cone-beam CT(CBCT) is performed. A robotic 6 DoF treatment couch (HexaPOD) then automatically corrects all remaining translations and rotations. This absolute position of infrared markers at the first fraction acts as reference for the following fractions where patients are manually prepositioned to within +/- 2 mm and +/- 2 degrees of this IR reference position prior to final HexaPOD-based correction; consequently CBCT imaging is only required once at the first treatment fraction.The preclinical feasibility and attainable repositioning accuracy of this method was evaluated on a phantom and human volunteers as was the clinical efficacy on 7 pilot study patients.\nPhantom and volunteer manual IR-based prepositioning to within +/- 2 mm and +/- 2 degrees in 6 DoF was possible within a mean(+/- SD) of 90 +/- 31 and 56 +/- 22 seconds respectively.

Erlotinib and gefitinib, two EGFR-targeted agents, have been shown to be relevant drugs for lung cancer treatment. Recent studies demonstrate that lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2 receptors, is clinically effective against HER-2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In this report, we investigated the activity of lapatinib against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nWe selected the lung cancer cell line A549, which harbors genomic amplification of EGFR and HER-2. Proliferation, cell cycle analysis, clonogenic assays, and signaling cascade analyses (by western blot) were performed in vitro. In vivo experiments with A549 cells xenotransplanted into nude mice treated with lapatinib (with or without radiotherapy) were also carried out.\nLapatinib dramatically reduced cell proliferation (P < 0.0001), DNA synthesis (P < 0.006), and colony formation capacity (P < 0.0001) in A549 cells in vitro. Furthermore, lapatinib induced G1 cell cycle arrest (P < 0.0001) and apoptotic cell death (P < 0.0006) and reduced cyclin A and B1 levels, which are regulators of S and G2/M cell cycle stages, respectively. Stimulation of apoptosis in lapatinib-treated A549 cells was correlated with increased cleaved PARP, active caspase-3, and proapoptotic Bak-1 levels, and reduction in the antiapoptotic IAP-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels. We also demonstrate that lapatinib altered EGFR/HER-2 signaling pathways reducing p-EGFR, p-HER-2, p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, c-Myc and PCNA levels. In vivo experiments revealed that A549 tumor-bearing mice treated with lapatinib had significantly less active tumors (as assessed by PET analysis) (P < 0.04) and smaller in size than controls. In addition, tumors from lapatinib-treated mice showed a dramatic reduction in angiogenesis (P < 0.0001).\nOverall, these data suggest that lapatinib may be a clinically useful agent for the treatment of lung cancer.", "journal": "BMC cancer", "date": "2010-05-13", "authors": ["RoqueDiaz", "Paul ANguewa", "RicardoParrondo", "CarlosPerez-Stable", "IreneManrique", "MiriamRedrado", "RaulCatena", "MariaCollantes", "IvanPe\u00f1uelas", "Juan AntonioD\u00edaz-Gonz\u00e1lez", "AlfonsoCalvo"], "doi": "10.1186/1471-2407-10-188\n10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0320\n10.1016/S0169-5002(03)00137-5\n10.1056/NEJMoa0904554\n10.1016/S0959-8049(01)00231-3\n10.1200/JCO.2003.11.069\n10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2072\n10.1111/j.1365-2184.2007.00455.x\n10.1200/JCO.2008.17.5349\n10.1038/ncponc1161\n10.1667/RR3224\n10.1056/NEJMoa011954\n10.3322/caac.20006\n10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67625-8\n10.1056/NEJMoa064320\n10.1200/JCO.2007.14.0590\n10.1200/JCO.2007.12.3588\n10.1124/mol.107.034827\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1182\n10.1016/j.canlet.2008.07.018\n10.1002/jcp.20816\n10.1016/j.coi.2007.05.004\n10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0729\n10.1124/mol.108.047365\n10.1016/j.lungcan.2007.08.012\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3700\n10.1038/onc.2009.277\n10.1038/nrc1971\n10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4654\n10.1182/blood-2003-10-3479\n10.1034/j.1399-0012.2002.02035.x"}

This is largely because of all new cases, about 70% present as superficial disease and this while rarely fatal, tends to recur, requiring long-term follow-up and repeat interventions. The standard of care, intravesical chemo- and immunotherapy, while effective, is associated with a considerable side-effect profile and approximately 30% of patients either fail to respond to treatment or suffer recurrent disease within 5 years. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is life threatening, showing modest chemosensitivity, and usually requires radical cystectomy. Although bladder cancer is fairly well-genetically characterized, clinical trials with molecularly targeted agents have, in comparison to other solid tumors such as lung, breast and prostate, been few in number and largely unsuccessful, with no new agents being registered in the last 20 years.

{"title": "Treatment response assessment of breast masses on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance scans using fuzzy c-means clustering and level set segmentation.", "abstract": "The goal of this study was to develop an automated method to segment breast masses on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) scans and to evaluate its potential for estimating tumor volume on pre- and postchemotherapy images and tumor change in response to treatment. A radiologist experienced in interpreting breast MR scans defined a cuboid volume of interest (VOI) enclosing the mass in the MR volume at one time point within the sequence of DCE-MR scans. The corresponding VOIs over the entire time sequence were then automatically extracted. A new 3D VOI representing the local pharmacokinetic activities in the VOI was generated from the 4D VOI sequence by summarizing the temporal intensity enhancement curve of each voxel with its standard deviation. The method then used the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm followed by morphological filtering for initial mass segmentation. The initial segmentation was refined by the 3D level set (LS) method. The velocity field of the LS method was formulated in terms of the mean curvature which guaranteed the smoothness of the surface, the Sobel edge information which attracted the zero LS to the desired mass margin, and the FCM membership function which improved segmentation accuracy. The method was evaluated on 50 DCE-MR scans of 25 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Each patient had pre- and postchemotherapy DCE-MR scans on a 1.5 T magnet. The in-plane pixel size ranged from 0.546 to 0.703 mm and the slice thickness ranged from 2.5 to 4.5 mm. The flip angle was 15 degrees, repetition time ranged from 5.98 to 6.7 ms, and echo time ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 ms. Computer segmentation was applied to the coronal T1-weighted images. For comparison, the same radiologist who marked the VOI also manually segmented the mass on each slice. The performance of the automated method was quantified using an overlap measure, defined as the ratio of the intersection of the computer and the manual segmentation volumes to the manual segmentation volume. Pre- and postchemotherapy masses had overlap measures of 0.81 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- s.d.) and 0.71 +/- 0.22, respectively. The percentage volume reduction (PVR) estimated by computer and the radiologist were 55.5 +/- 43.0% (mean +/- s.d.) and 57.8 +/- 51.3%, respectively. Paired Student's t test indicated that the difference between the mean PVRs estimated by computer and the radiologist did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.641).

However, gliomas are highly radioresistant and recurrence is nearly universal. Results from our laboratory and other groups suggest that cancer stem cells contribute to radioresistance in gliomas and breast cancers. The Notch pathway is critically implicated in stem cell fate determination and cancer. In this study, we show that inhibition of Notch pathway with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) renders the glioma stem cells more sensitive to radiation at clinically relevant doses. GSIs enhance radiation-induced cell death and impair clonogenic survival of glioma stem cells but not non-stem glioma cells. Expression of the constitutively active intracellular domains of Notch1 or Notch2 protect glioma stem cells against radiation. Notch inhibition with GSIs does not alter the DNA damage response of glioma stem cells after radiation but rather reduces Akt activity and Mcl-1 levels. Finally, knockdown of Notch1 or Notch2 sensitizes glioma stem cells to radiation and impairs xenograft tumor formation. Taken together, our results suggest a critical role of Notch signaling to regulate radioresistance of glioma stem cells.

Our objectives were to (1) examine the impact of AIs and no-AIs on hip structural geometry (HSA) of chemotherapy-induced postmenopausal women, and (2) determine if oral bisphosphonates could affect these changes.\nThis is a sub-analysis of a 2-year double-blind randomized trial of 67 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer, newly postmenopausal following chemotherapy (up to 8 years), who were randomized to risedronate, 35 mg once weekly (RIS) and placebo (PBO). Many women changed their cancer therapy from a no-AI to an AI during the trial. Outcomes were changes in Beck's HSA-derived BMD and structural parameters.\nEighteen women did not receive adjuvant hormone therapy, while 41 women received other therapy and 8 received AIs at baseline distributed similarly between RIS and PBO. Women on AIs and PBO were found to have the lowest BMD and indices. RIS improved BMD and several HSA indices at the intertrochanteric site in women regardless of their hormonal therapy, but most improvement was observed in women who were not on AIs (all p< or =0.05 except buckling ratio).

{"title": "Targeted therapy of metastatic breast cancer.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterised by a dysregulation of multiple pathways related to cell differentiation, cell cycle control, apoptosis, angiogenesis and development of metastasis. Acting against these pathways provides therapeutic targets for new targeted biologic therapies, which, in the future, might constitute a key for fighting cancer. The development of molecular technology in recent years has allowed a further comprehension of these mutations and dysregulated pathways leading to oncogenesis. New targeted biologic therapies will block essential functions of cancer cells and tumour stroma. A growing number of therapy options, alone or in combination with background treatments (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiotherapy), will allow oncologists a better adaptation of treatment to patients and disease characteristics. Examples of approved targeted agents in breast cancer include agents targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), such as trastuzumab, lapatinib and the anti-VEGF bevacizumab. In addition, there are other therapy classes under evaluation, including novel antiEGFR or antiHER2 therapies; agents fighting other tyrosine kinases, including the Src and the insulinlike growth factor receptor; agents interfering critically relevant pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors; and agents promoting apoptosis, such as PARP inhibitors (for particular breast cancer subtypes, such as basal-like, or breast cancer with BRCA mutations) and others. The better selectivity against malignant cells of these therapies, when compared to conventional chemotherapy, gives, a priori, at least two advantages to biologic treatments: fewer side effects and a more individualised treatment of cancer depending on the tumour's molecular characteristics. The ability to identify patients' subgroups and response predicting factors will be crucial in obtaining the greatest benefit with minimal toxicity levels. Unsolved questions remain, such as appropriate patient selection based on the expression of the therapeutic target in the tumour, the study of the efficacy of the drug in not so extensively pretreated populations and with a greater chance of response, the use of new pharmacodynamic models to help to define new response predicting factors for a specific new biologic therapy, the combined and rational use of different biologic therapies having different molecular targets and fighting the same target through a complementary mechanism of action that might improve clinical efficacy.", "journal": "Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico", "date": "2009-10-16", "authors": ["AlfonsoS\u00e1nchez-Mu\u00f1oz", "ElisabethP\u00e9rez-Ruiz", "Bego\u00f1aJim\u00e9nez", "NuriaRibelles", "AntoniaM\u00e1rquez", "IsabelGarc\u00eda-R\u00edos", "EmilioAlba Conejo"], "doi": "10.1007/s12094-009-0419-6"}
{"title": "LHRH agonists for adjuvant therapy of early breast cancer in premenopausal women.", "abstract": "Approximately 60% of breast cancers amongst premenopausal women express the nuclear oestrogen receptor (ER+ breast cancer). Adjuvant endocrine therapy is an integral component of care for ER+ breast cancer, exerting its effect by reducing the availability of oestrogen to micrometastatic tumour cells. Endocrine strategies in premenopausal women include oestrogen receptor blockade with tamoxifen, temporary suppression of ovarian oestrogen synthesis by luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, or permanent interruption of ovarian oestrogen synthesis with oophorectomy or radiotherapy. Aromatase inhibitors are also available with concurrent suppression of ovarian oestrogen synthesis, either through LHRH agonists, surgery, or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy can also have an endocrine action in premenopausal women by interrupting ovarian oestrogen production, either temporarily or permanently. International consensus statements recommend single agent tamoxifen as the current standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women (often preceded by chemotherapy), and the role of LHRH agonists remains under active investigation.\nTo assess LHRH agonists as adjuvant therapy for women with early breast cancer.\nThe Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register was searched on 19 February 2009. This register incorporates references from CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library) (to 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2008), EMBASE (until 2002); and handsearches of abstracts from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, and the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia Annual Meeting. MEDLINE references (from August 2008 to 19th February 2009) were checked by the authors. The reference lists of related reviews were checked. A final check of the list of trials maintained by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group was made in January 2008.\nAll randomised trials assessing LHRH agonists as adjuvant treatment in premenopausal women with early stage breast cancer were included. Specifically, we included trials that compared:(A) LHRH agonists (experimental arm) versus another treatment;(B) LHRH agonists + anti-oestrogen (experimental arm) versus another treatment;(C) LHRH agonists + chemotherapy (experimental arm) versus another treatment;(D) LHRH agonists + anti-oestrogen + chemotherapy (experimental arm) versus another treatment.\nData were collected from trial reports. We reported estimates for the differences between treatments on recurrence free survival, overall survival, toxicity and quality of life using data available in the reports of each trial. Meta-analyses were not performed because of variability in the reporting of the trials.\nWe identified 14 randomised trials that involved over 13,000 premenopausal women with operable breast cancer, most of whom were ER+. The numbers of trials making the different comparisons were:(A) i. LHRH versus tamoxifen (three trials),ii. LHRH versus chemotherapy (four trials);(B) i. LHRH + tamoxifen versus tamoxifen (two trials),ii. LHRH + tamoxifen versus LHRH (three trials),iii. LHRH + tamoxifen versus chemotherapy (two trials),iv. LHRH + aromatase inhibitor versus LHRH + tamoxifen (one trial);(C) i. LHRH + chemotherapy versus LHRH (one trial),ii. LHRH + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (five trials);(D) LHRH + tamoxifen + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (three trials).The LHRH agonist in most of these trials was goserelin.For most of the treatment comparisons there are too few trials, too few randomised patients, or too little follow up to draw reliable estimates of the relative effects of different treatments.(A) LHRH monotherapy: results suggest that adjuvant LHRH agonist monotherapy is similar to older chemotherapy protocols (eg. CMF) in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival in ER+ patients. There are insufficient data to compare LHRH agonist monotherapy to tamoxifen alone, but available results suggest that these treatments are comparable in terms of recurrence-free survival.(B) LHRH + anti-oestrogen therapy: there are insufficient data to compare the combination of an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen to tamoxifen alone. Results suggest that the LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen combination may be superior to an LHRH agonist alone or to chemotherapy alone, but the chemotherapy protocols tested are outdated. The data comparing LHRH agonists plus aromatase inhibitors to LHRH agonists plus tamoxifen are currently inconclusive.(C) LHRH + chemotherapy: there are insufficient data to compare the LHRH + chemotherapy combination to an LHRH agonist alone, although results from a single study suggest comparable efficacy in ER+ patients. There is a trend towards improved recurrence-free and overall survival in patients who received an LHRH agonist plus chemotherapy combination in comparison to chemotherapy alone.(D) LHRH agonist + chemotherapy + tamoxifen: there is a trend towards improved recurrence-free and overall survival in patients who received an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in comparison to chemotherapy alone.There are insufficient data to assess the effect of the addition of LHRH agonists to the current standard treatment of chemotherapy plus tamoxifen.Endocrine therapy with LHRH agonists appears to have fewer side-effects than the forms of chemotherapy assessed. The optimal duration of LHRH therapy in the adjuvant setting is unclear.\nOverall, the data from currently published clinical trials of LHRH agonists in the adjuvant setting for premenopausal women with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer are supportive of clinical benefit. Nonetheless, definitive comparisons against current clinical standards of care that include third generation chemotherapy regimens and tamoxifen are required before their place in the adjuvant setting can be properly defined. The authors conclude that the current data strongly support the continuation of current trials that definitively compare a variety of combinations of LHRH agonists and anti-oestrogenic strategies to the current standard of five years of tamoxifen.", "journal": "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews", "date": "2009-10-13", "authors": ["ShomGoel", "RohiniSharma", "AnneHamilton", "JaneBeith"], "doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD004562.pub4\n10.1002/14651858.CD000485"}

This work was demonstrated using a voxel-based analysis of ADC change during therapy in the brains of both rats and humans, following rigidly registering pre- and post-therapeutic ADC MRI exams. The primary goal of this paper is to extend this voxel-by-voxel analysis to assess therapeutic response in breast cancer. Nonlinear registration (with higher degrees of freedom) between the pre- and post-treatment exams is needed to ensure that the corresponding voxels actually contain similar cellular partial contributions due to soft tissue deformations in the breast and compartmental tumor changes during treatment as well. With limited data sets, we have observed the correlation between changes of ADC values and treatment response also exists in breast cancers. With diffusion scans acquired at three different timepoints (pre-treatment, early post-treatment and late post-treatment), we have also shown that ADC changes across responders within 5 weeks are a function of time interval after the initiation of treatment.

{"title": "Radiation responses of cancer stem cells.", "abstract": "Recent experimental evidence indicates that many solid cancers have a hierarchical organization structure with a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The ability to identify CSCs prospectively now allows for testing the responses of CSCs to treatment modalities like radiation therapy. Initial studies have found CSCs in glioma and breast cancer relatively resistant to ionizing radiation and possible mechanisms behind this resistance have been explored. This review summarizes the landmark publications in this young field with an emphasis on the radiation responses of CSCs. The existence of CSCs in solid cancers place restrictions on the interpretation of many radiobiological observations, while explaining others. The fact that these cells may be a relatively quiescent subpopulation that are metabolically distinct from the other cells in the tumor has implications for both imaging and therapy of cancer. This is particularly true for biological targeting of cancer for enhanced radiotherapeutic benefit, which must consider whether the unique properties of this subpopulation allow it to avoid such therapies.", "journal": "Journal of cellular biochemistry", "date": "2009-07-23", "authors": ["ErinaVlashi", "William HMcBride", "FrankPajonk"], "doi": "10.1002/jcb.22275"}

{"title": "Evaluation of clip localization for different kilovoltage imaging modalities as applied to partial breast irradiation setup.", "abstract": "Surgical clip localization and image quality were evaluated for different types of kilovoltage cone beam imaging modalities as applied to partial breast irradiation (PBI) setup. These modalities included (i) clinically available radiographs and cone beam CT (CB-CT) and (ii) various alternative modalities based on partial/sparse/truncated CB-CT. An anthropomorphic torso-breast phantom with surgical clips was used for the imaging studies. The torso phantom had artificial lungs, and the attached breast phantom was a mammographic phantom with realistic shape and tissue inhomogeneities. Three types of clips of variable size were used in two orthogonal orientations to assess their in-/cross-plane characteristics for image-guided setup of the torso-breast phantom in supine position. All studies were performed with the Varian on-board imaging (OBI, Varian) system. CT reconstructions were calculated with the standard Feldkamp-Davis-Kress algorithm. First, the radiographs were studied for a wide range of viewing angles to characterize image quality for various types of body anatomy in the foreground/background of the clips. Next, image reconstruction quality was evaluated for partial/sparse/truncated CB-CT. Since these modalities led to reconstructions with strong artifacts due to insufficient input data, a knowledge-based CT reconstruction method was also tested. In this method, the input data to the reconstruction algorithm were modified by combining complementary data sets selected from the treatment and reference projections. Different partial/sparse/truncated CB-CT scan types were studied depending on the total are angle, angular increment between the consequent views (CT projections), orientation of the arc center with respect to the imaged breast and chest wall, and imaging field size. The central angles of the viewing arcs were either tangential or orthogonal to the chest wall. Several offset positions of the phantom with respect to the reference position were studied. The acquired and reconstructed image data sets were analyzed using home-built software focusing on the ability to localize clips in 3D. Streaking and leakage reconstruction artifacts and spatial distortions of breast surface were analyzed as well. Advantages and disadvantages of each kilovoltage CB imaging modality as applied to partial breast setup evaluation based on clips are presented. Because clips were found to be difficult to recognize in radiographs, 3D reconstructions were preferred. Even though it was possible to localize clips with about +/-1 mm accuracy based on reconstructions for short arcs of 40 degrees and incremental angle up to about 5 degrees, identification of clips in such reconstructions is difficult. Reconstructions obtained for arcs of as low as 80 degrees and incremental angle of as high as 3 degrees were suggested for easier clip identification. For more severely undersampled data, iterative CB-CT reconstruction is recommended to decrease the artifacts.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2009-04-22", "authors": ["AndreasBuehler", "Sook-KienNg", "YuliaLyatskaya", "DzmitryStsepankou", "JurgenHesser", "PiotrZygmanski"], "doi": "10.1118/1.3075904"}

{"title": "Evaluation of the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 in multicellular tumour spheroids with respect to effects on growth and PET tracer uptake.", "abstract": "Molecular targeting has become a prominent concept in cancer treatment and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors are suggested as promising anticancer drugs. The Hsp90 complex is one of the chaperones that facilitate the refolding of unfolded or misfolded proteins and plays a role for key oncogenic proteins such as Her2, Raf-1, Akt/PKB, and mutant p53. NVP-AUY922 is a novel low-molecular Hsp90 inhibitor, currently under clinical development as an anticancer drug. Disruption of the Hsp90-client protein complexes leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of client proteins and cell death. The aim of the current study was to use a combination of the multicellular tumour spheroid (MTS) model and positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the effects of NVP-AUY922 on tumour growth and its relation to PET tracer uptake for the selection of appropriate PET tracer. A further aim was to evaluate the concentration and time dependence in the relation between growth inhibition and PET tracer uptake as part of translational imaging activities.\nMTS of two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and BT474), one glioblastoma cell line (U87MG) and one colon carcinoma cell line (HCT116) were prepared. Initially, we investigated MTS growth pattern and (3)H-thymidine incorporation in MTS after continuous exposure to NVP-AUY922 in order to determine dose response. Then the short-term effect of the drug on the four PET tracers 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT), methionine and choline was correlated to the long-term effect (changes in growth pattern) to determine the adequate PET tracer with high predictability. Next, the growth inhibitory effect of different dose schedules was evaluated to determine the optimal dose and time. Finally, the effect of a 2-h exposure to the drug on growth pattern and FDG/FLT uptake was evaluated.\nA dose-dependent inhibition of growth and decrease of (3)H-thymidine uptake was observed with 100% growth cessation in the dose range 7-52 nM and 50% (3)H-thymidine reduction in the range of 10-23 nM, with the most pronounced effect on BT474 cells. The effect of the drug was best detected by FLT. The results suggested that a complete cessation of growth of the viable cell volume was achieved with about 50% inhibition of FLT uptake 3 days after continuous treatment. Significant growth inhibition was observed at all doses and all exposure time spans. Two-hour exposure to NVP-AUY922 generated a growth inhibition which persisted dose dependently up to 10 days. The uptake of FDG per viable tumour volume was reduced by just 25% with 300 nM treatment of the drug, whereas the FLT uptake decreased up to 75% in correlation with the growth inhibition and recovery.\nOur results indicate a prolonged action of NVP-AUY922 in this cell culture, FLT is a suitable tracer for the monitoring of the effect and a FLT PET study within 3 days after treatment can predict the treatment outcome in this model.

Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms.

{"title": "Enhancing radiosensitivity: targeting the DNA repair pathways.", "abstract": "Radiotherapy is very effective in local control of cancerous tumors, but its curative potential is often limited by intrinsic radioresistance of the tumor cells. Since DNA repair pathways remove radiation-induced DNA lesions and protect cells from lethality, these pathways represent potential therapeutic targets to radiosensitize tumors. In order to achieve a therapeutic gain, however, there must be a differential between tumor and normal cells that can be exploited to preferentially target the DNA repair of the tumor, while sparing surrounding normal tissues, and this has represented a significant challenge to progress. Nevertheless, recent advances in our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms and tumor biology, on both the biochemical and genetic levels, have identified molecular differentials that may increase tumor specificity. This mechanistic insight suggests new strategies for radiotherapeutic targeting of DNA repair. Some of these strategies are reviewed here, including synthetic lethal, replicative stress, cell cycle and hypoxia-based approaches.

{"title": "Even low-level HER2 expression may be associated with worse outcome in node-positive breast cancer.", "abstract": "HER2 is an important predictive marker for response to trastuzumab and lapatinib in breast cancer. It is also a powerful prognostic marker in node-positive patients. Although standardized assays are used to help select patients for anti-HER2 therapy, there are no standardized criteria for assessing HER2 as a prognostic marker. Recent data using quantitative image analysis suggest that both high and low HER2 expression are associated with poor clinical outcome. Using the immunohistochemical scoring criteria currently recommended by the College of American Pathologists and American Society of Clinical Oncology to help select patients for trastuzumab, we evaluated HER2 protein expression in tumor tissue microarrays of 91 node-positive patients with invasive breast carcinoma treated with mastectomy and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy without trastuzumab and without irradiation with a median follow-up of 12.5 years. A wide range of HER2 expression (HER2 >or=1+) in the primary tumor was significantly associated with decreased locoregional recurrence-free survival (P=0.014), decreased disease-specific survival (P=0.001), and decreased overall survival (P=0.001). Even in the subset considered HER2 negative by current College of American Pathologists and American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, HER2=1+ was associated with worse outcome than HER2=0 in this patient cohort. The association between HER2 >or=1+ and worse outcome had the greatest statistical significance in the hormone receptor-positive subset of patients. These findings support the hypothesis that low-level HER2 expression may have significant clinical implications.

Interestingly, NF-kappaB is required for radiation-induced HER2 transactivation. HER2 was found to be co-activated with basal and radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity in radioresistant but not radiosensitive breast cancer cell lines after long-term radiation exposure, indicating that NF-kappaB-mediated HER2 overexpression is involved in radiation-induced repopulation in heterogeneous tumors.

Consequently, FASN is a novel target for cancer therapy. However, because FASN inhibitors can lead to tumor stasis rather than shrinkage, noninvasive methods for assessing FASN inhibition are needed. To this end, we combined (1)H, (31)P, and (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (a) to monitor the metabolic consequences of FASN inhibition and (b) to identify MRS-detectable metabolic biomarkers of response. Treatment of PC-3 cells with the FASN inhibitor Orlistat for up to 48 h resulted in inhibition of FASN activity by 70%, correlating with 74% inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, we have determined that FASN inhibition results not only in lower phosphatidylcholine levels but also in a 59% drop in the phospholipid precursor phosphocholine (PCho). This drop resulted from inhibition in PCho synthesis as a result of a reduction in the cellular activity of its synthetic enzyme choline kinase. The drop in PCho levels following FASN inhibition was confirmed in SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells treated with Orlistat and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with Orlistat as well as cerulenin. Combining data from all treated cells, the drop in PCho significantly correlated with the drop in de novo synthesized fatty acid levels, identifying PCho as a potential noninvasive MRS-detectable biomarker of FASN inhibition in vivo.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2008-08-30", "authors": ["JamesRoss", "Amer MNajjar", "MadhuriSankaranarayanapillai", "William PTong", "KumaralalKaluarachchi", "Sabrina MRonen"], "doi": "10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0015"}

A method to reduce breast cancer risk in this population of women is urgently needed. We hypothesized that adding aromatase inhibitors (AIs) to HT would reduce local breast estrogen exposure and breast cancer risk without altering the beneficial systemic effects of HT on menopausal symptoms or bone density. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of AIs and HT on mammographic breast density (MBD) as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women receiving low-dose HT.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study conducted at private clinics affiliated with a university hospital. One group of postmenopausal women (n = 28) received low-dose HT daily plus letrozole 2.5 mg three times weekly. Postmenopausal women receiving HT alone (n = 28) served as controls. MBD, the primary outcome, was measured using quantitative image analysis software as well as by visual analysis by a radiologist. Hypoestrogenic effects, adverse reactions, and bone mineral densities were secondary outcome measures.\nThe mammograms of 18 women in the study group and 22 women in the control group were suitable for comparison. A statistically significant reduction in MBD occurred in the women who received HT plus an AI, whereas no significant change was observed in the women receiving HT alone. There was no significant increase in hypoestrogenic symptoms during the use of AIs, and bone mineral densities were not significantly reduced.\nAdding an AI to HT may lower MBD in postmenopausal women.

The growth factor receptor, Her2/neu, is overexpressed in 25-30% of breast tumors. Tumors that are Her2(+) may have an altered state of oxygenation, relative to Her2(-) tumors, due to differences in tumor growth rate and angiogenesis.\nHer2 blockade was accomplished using an antibody to the receptor (trastuzumab; Herceptin). This study examined the effects of Her2 blockade on tumor angiogenesis, vascular architecture, and hypoxia in Her2(+) and Her2(-) MCF7 xenograft tumors.\nTreatment with trastuzumab in Her2(+) tumors significantly improved tumor oxygenation, increased microvessel density, and improved vascular architecture compared with the control-treated Her2(+) tumors. The Her2(+) xenografts treated with trastuzumab also demonstrated decreased proliferation indices when compared with control-treated xenografts. These results indicate that Her2 blockade can improve tumor oxygenation by decreasing oxygen consumption (reducing tumor cell proliferation and inducing necrosis) and increasing oxygen delivery (vascular density and architecture).\nThese results support the use of trastuzumab as an adjunct in the treatment of breast tumors with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as improvements in tumor oxygenation should translate into improved treatment response.", "journal": "Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology", "date": "2008-03-28", "authors": ["Matthew EHardee", "Rose JEapen", "Zahid NRabbani", "Matthew RDreher", "JeffreyMarks", "Kimberly LBlackwell", "Mark WDewhirst"], "doi": "10.1007/s00280-008-0729-3"}

{"title": "Acquisition of stable inducible up-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB by tumor necrosis factor exposure confers increased radiation resistance without increased transformation in breast cancer cells.", "abstract": "High-grade breast cancers are better adapted to hypoxia and more resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Constitutive activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) increases in breast tumors and in breast cancer cell lines, where it promotes chemoradiation resistance, in part by activation of antiapoptotic genes. The role for up-regulation of NF-kappaB in breast cancer progression is less clear. Here, we first show that whereas the constitutive activity of NF-kappaB is incrementally elevated from immortalized breast epithelial to frank transformed invasive ductal breast cancer cell lines (~3-fold, +/-0.1-fold, P < 0.05), inflammatory cytokine-inducible activity is further increased (up to 9-fold, +/-0.9-fold, P < 0.05). We then show that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity selectively sensitizes transformed but not immortalized cells to killing by ionizing radiation or low levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by up to 10-fold (+/-1-fold, P < 0.05) but has little effect on hypoxia-mediated cell death. Prolonged cultivation of immortalized and partially transformed cells in TNF selected for cells displaying stable constitutive and strongly inducible overexpression of NF-kappaB even in the absence of TNF. Stable acquisition of increased NF-kappaB activity conferred resistance to ionizing radiation or inflammatory cytokines, which was dependent on elevated NF-kappaB activity, but had no effect on transformation potential measured by in vitro and in vivo parameters. Thus, TNF and possibly other inflammatory cytokines in the tumor-stroma matrix likely select for breast cancer cells that stably overexpress NF-kappaB, leading to greater cancer cell survival. Greater cell survival despite increased genomic injury may permit increased acquisition of malignant genetic alterations as well as resistance to chemoradiation therapy.", "journal": "Molecular cancer research : MCR", "date": "2008-02-01", "authors": ["SteveBraunstein", "Silvia CFormenti", "Robert JSchneider"], "doi": "10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-0339"}

We investigated the effects of combination treatment with transient siRNA-chk transfection and the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in those cell lines. Microarray analysis of the invasive estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line was done to characterize molecular changes associated with Chk down-regulation. Chk down-regulation decreased PC and tCho levels in the malignant cell lines, whereas the cell viability/proliferation assays detected a decrease in proliferation in these cells. In contrast, Chk down-regulation had an almost negligible effect on PC and tCho levels as well as cell viability/proliferation in the nonmalignant cell line. A combination of siRNA-chk with 5-FU treatment resulted in a larger reduction of cell viability/proliferation in the breast cancer cell lines; this reduction was evident to a much lesser degree in the nonmalignant cells.

Immunofluorescence was employed to determine the cellular expression of ABCG2. The ABCG2 expression in ARO and WRO cell lines was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Inactivation of EGFR kinase by gefitinib was analyzed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay was performed to demonstrate ABCG2-mediated apoptosis in the presence of doxorubicin. Colony formation assays were performed to determine the effect of gefitinib on thyroid cancer cell survival in response to gefitinib, doxorubicin, or the combination of both drugs.\nInhibition of EGFR kinase activity by gefitinib causes the translocation of the ABCG2 drug transporter away from the plasma membrane, resulting in a concomitant decrease in doxorubicin extrusion in thyroid cancer cell lines. Both ARO and WRO demonstrated differential ABCG2 expression, whereas both were sensitized to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis on ABCG2 knockdown with short interfering RNA.

Indications for radiotherapy, as well as the steps and methods, are similar to that for female breast cancer. Because 90% of the patients are estrogen receptor-positive, tamoxifen is a standard adjuvant therapy, but some individuals could also benefit from chemotherapy.

This study was conceived to evaluate the correlation between hybrid (18)F-FDG PET/CT and apoptosis in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were given to forty-five patients with primary breast cancer proven by core needle biopsy. Hybrid PET/CT was performed before and after treatment and tumor to non-tumor radioactivity ratio (T/N) was calculated. The apoptotic index (AI) in core-cut and surgically resected samples was determined using TUNEL techniques. The mean T/N pre- and postchemotherapy was 3.23 +/- 0.63 and 2.31 +/- 0.49, respectively (p = 0.006), with the mean reduction rate below baseline of 31.18 +/- 13.18% (range, 6.4-50.8%). The mean AI pre- and post-chemotherapy was 2.81 +/- 0.76% and 17.31 +/- 6.85%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean AI change was 14.34 +/- 5.36% (range, 1.9-41.3%). A positive correlation was detected between the T/N reduction rate and AI change (r(s) = 0.850, p < 0.0001). At a threshold of 20% decrease from baseline in T/N, the mean AI change in the tumors with a reduction of 20% or more in T/N was 20.86 +/- 4.29%, while that in the tumors with a reduction of less than 20% in T/N was 8.59 +/- 2.87% (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the accuracy of PET/CT for the prediction of clinical response were 90.9%, 83.3%, 93.8%, 76.9% and 92%, respectively.

We investigated the radiosensitizing effect of enzastaurin, a protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta) inhibitor, on bone tumor growth and tumor-related pain. We found that enzastaurin enhanced the effect of ionizing radiation on cultured murine 4T1 breast cancer and murine endothelial cells, suppressing their proliferation and colony formation. Enzastaurin and ionizing radiation also induced caspase-mediated apoptosis of 4T1 cells to a greater degree than radiation alone. Enzastaurin treatment of 4T1 cells blocked the phosphorylation of PKCbeta, as well as Ras and two of its downstream effectors ERK1/2 and RAL-GTP. Using an orthotopic model of bone metastasis, we observed that a combination of enzastaurin and localized radiation treatment reduced tumor blood vessel density, bone destruction and pain compared to single modality treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of PKCbeta in combination with localized radiation treatment suppresses tumor growth and alleviates pain as compared to radiation-only treatment. We also show that the radiosensitizing effect of enzastaurin is associated with suppression of tumor cell proliferation and tumor-induced angiogenesis possibly through inhibition of the Ras pathway.", "journal": "Investigational new drugs", "date": "2007-09-07", "authors": ["Arkadiusz ZDudek", "PawelZwolak", "PiotrJasinski", "KaoruTerai", "Nathan JGallus", "Marna EEricson", "FarisFarassati"], "doi": "10.1007/s10637-007-9079-y"}

Computer simulation was performed to investigate: 1) the relationship between the SER and the contrast agent concentration ratio (CACR) of two postcontrast timepoints (tp1 and tp2); 2) the relationship between the CACR and the redistribution rate constant (kep) based on a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model; and 3) the sensitivity of the relationship between the SER and kep to native tissue T1 relaxation time, T10, and to errors in an assumed vascular input function. The relationship between SER and kep was verified experimentally using a mouse model of breast cancer. The results showed that a monotonic mathematical relationship between SER and kep could be established if the acquisition parameters and the two postinjection timepoints of SER, tp1, tp2, were appropriately chosen.

{"title": "Targeting the virus with radioimmunotherapy in virus-associated cancers.", "abstract": "\"Virus-associated cancer\" (VAC) refers to a cancer where viral infection results in the malignant transformation of the host's infected cells. Examples of viruses linked to cancers are the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is associated with lymphomas, as well as nasopharyngeal and breast cancer; hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), which are both associated with hepatocellular carcinoma; and human papilloma viruses (HPVs), which are associated with cancer of the cervix. We have recently demonstrated that HIV-1-infected cells can be eliminated in vitro and in vivo by targeting viral glycoproteins expressed on the surface of infected cells with radiolabeled viral protein-specific monoclonal antibodies and proposed that this approach can be applicable to the broad range of viral infectious diseases. In VAC, the tumor cells can exhibit viral antigens both internally or on their surfaces. As a result, viral antigens in tumors represent a potential antigenic target that is clearly different from normal tissues. In principle, these proteins could be targeted by radioimmunotherapy (RIT). In this paper, we describe the potential of this approach and review some of the issues involved in the development of this approach.

The immunoreactivity of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab was determined by its ability to displace the binding of trastuzumab to SK-BR-3 human breast cancer (BC) cells. Cellular uptake and nuclear localization were evaluated in SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-231 BC cells, expressing high, intermediate, or very low levels of HER2/neu, respectively, by cell fractionation and confocal microscopy. Biodistribution and nuclear uptake were compared in athymic mice bearing MDA-MB-361 xenografts. The cytotoxicity of (111)In-trastuzumab and (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab was studied by clonogenic assays, and DNA damage was assessed by probing for phosphorylated histone H2AX (gammaH2AX) foci.\nThe dissociation constant for binding of (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab to SK-BR-3 cells was reduced <3-fold compared with that of (111)In-trastuzumab, demonstrating relatively preserved receptor-binding affinity. The receptor-mediated internalization of (111)In-trastuzumab in SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-231 cells increased significantly from 7.2% +/- 0.9%, 1.3% +/- 0.1%, and 0.2% +/- 0.05% to 14.4% +/- 1.8%, 6.3% +/- 0.2%, and 0.9% +/- 0.2% for (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab harboring 6 NLS-peptides, respectively. NLS-trastuzumab localized in the nuclei of BC cells, whereas unmodified trastuzumab remained surface-bound. Conjugation of (111)In-trastuzumab to NLS-peptides did not affect its tissue biodistribution but promoted specific nuclear uptake in MDA-MB-361 xenografts (2.4-2.9 %ID/g [percentage injected dose per gram] for (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab and 1.1 %ID/g for (111)In-trastuzumab).

(111)In-NLS-trastuzumab was 6-fold more effective at killing SK-BR-3 cells than unlabeled trastuzumab. Formation of gammaH2AX foci occurred in a greater proportion of BC cells after incubation with (111)In-NLS-trastuzumab compared with (111)In-trastuzumab or unlabeled trastuzumab.\nNLS-peptides routed (111)In-trastuzumab to the nucleus of HER2/neu-positive human BC cells, rendering the radiopharmaceutical lethal to the cells through the emission of nanometer-micrometer range Auger electrons.

We therefore examined the ability of three segmentation methods-thresholding, Sobel edge detection, and the watershed approach-to yield accurate delineation of PET target cross-sections. A phantom study employing well-defined cylindrical and spherical volumes and activity distributions provided an opportunity to assess the relative efficacy with which the three approaches could yield accurate target delineation in PET. Results revealed that threshold segmentation can accurately delineate target cross-sections, but that the Sobel and watershed techniques both consistently fail to correctly identify the size of experimental volumes.

In advanced disease the case for the use of AIs is well established but in the adjuvant and chemoprevention settings some worries about long-term safety remain. Large numbers of women may already be cured by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy making further adjuvant treatment unnecessary. In chemoprevention the ratio of risks to putative benefits remains very unclear, so results from major trials are needed to clarify. When making decisions about treatment women need information about: the available options, likely therapeutic gains, predicted side-effects and convenience of treatment. Adherence is then dependent on the actual burden experienced and impact on QoL. Healthcare professionals often underestimate non-life-threatening but QoL-threatening side-effects, making treatments appear more favorable and acceptable during discussion about therapeutic options. It was hoped that AIs would enhance efficacy without producing unacceptable side-effects that diminish QoL and reduce adherence. Recently published results from the QoL sub-protocols of ATAC, IES and MA-17, looking at anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole, respectively, provide useful indications about the QoL associated with AIs.

This study describes the synthesis of eight divalent versions of TA138 and their evaluation as potential tumor radiotherapeutic agents. The two main variables in this study were the length of the spacer bridging the biotargeting moieties and the total negative charge of the molecules imparted by the cysteic acid pharmacokinetic modifiers. Receptor affinity was evaluated in a panel of integrin receptor affinity assays, and biodistribution studies using the 111In-labeled derivatives were carried out in the c-neu Oncomouse model. All divalent agents maintained the high receptor affinity and selectivity of TA138, and six of the eight 111In derivatives exhibited blood clearance that was faster than 111In-TA138 at 24 h postinjection (PI). All divalent agents exhibited tumor uptake and retention at 24 h PI that was higher than 111In-TA138.

Two DCE-MRI protocols were evaluated: (1) a high molecular weight (MW) contrast agent (albumin-(GdDTPA)(30)) with pharmacokinetic analysis of the contrast uptake curve and (2) a low MW contrast agent (GdDTPA) with a clinically utilized empirical parametric analysis of the contrast uptake curve, the signal enhancement ratio (SER).

It is a well-established imaging modality for the diagnosis of osseous metastasis and for monitoring osseous tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although the sensitivity of bone scan examinations for detection of bone abnormalities has been considered to be relatively high, it is time consuming to identify multiple lesions such as bone metastases of prostate and breast cancers. In addition, it is very difficult to detect subtle interval changes between two successive abnormal bone scans, because of variations in patient conditions, the accumulation of radioisotopes during each examination, and the image quality of gamma cameras. Therefore, we developed a new computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) scheme for the detection of interval changes in successive whole-body bone scans by use of a temporal subtraction image which was obtained with a nonlinear image-warping technique. We carried out 58 pairs of successive bone scans in which each scan included both posterior and anterior views. We determined 107 \"gold-standard\" interval changes among the 58 pairs based on the consensus of three radiologists. Our computerized scheme consisted of seven steps, i.e., initial image density normalization on each image, image matching for the paired images, temporal subtraction by use of the nonlinear image-warping technique, initial detection of interval changes by use of temporal-subtraction images, image feature extraction of candidates of interval changes, rule-based tests by use of 16 image features for removing some false positives, and display of the computer output for identified interval changes. One hundred seven gold standard interval changes included 71 hot lesions (uptake was increased compared with the previous scan, or there was new uptake in the current scan) and 36 cold lesions (uptake was decreased or disappeared) for anterior and posterior views. The overall sensitivity in the detection of interval changes, including both hot and cold lesions evaluated by use of the resubstitution and the leave-one-case-out methods, were 95.3%, with 5.97 false positives per view, and 83.2% with 6.02, respectively. The temporal subtraction image for successive whole-body bone scans has the potential to enhance the interval changes between two images, which also can be quantified.

In cancer, IDO activity may help promote acquired tolerance to tumor antigens. The IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan is being developed for clinical trials. However, 1-methyl-tryptophan exists in two stereoisomers with potentially different biological properties, and it has been unclear which isomer might be preferable for initial development. In this study, we provide evidence that the D and L stereoisomers exhibit important cell type-specific variations in activity. The L isomer was the more potent inhibitor of IDO activity using the purified enzyme and in HeLa cell-based assays. However, the D isomer was significantly more effective in reversing the suppression of T cells created by IDO-expressing dendritic cells, using both human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and murine dendritic cells isolated directly from tumor-draining lymph nodes.

The absence of telomerase activity results in progressive telomere shortening, leading to cellular senescence or death through deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage signals. In addition, a role for telomerase in DNA damage repair has also been suggested. A specific telomerase inhibitor, GRN163L that is complementary to the template region of the telomerase ribonucleic acid component (hTR). We hypothesized that exposure to GRN163L, either through immediate inhibition of telomerase activity or through eventual telomere shortening and dysfunction, may enhance radiation sensitivity. Our goal was to test whether the treatment with GRN163L enhances sensitivity to irradiation (IR) in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.\nThe MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with or without GRN163L for 2-42 days. Inhibition of telomerase activity and shortening of telomeres were confirmed. Cells were then irradiated and clonogenic assays were performed to show cell survival differences. In vivo studies using MDA-MB-231 xenografts were performed to corroborate the in vitro results.\nWe show that cells with shortened telomeres due to GRN163L enhance the effect on IR reducing survival by an additional 30% (p < 0.01). These results are confirmed in vivo, with a significant decrease in tumor growth in mice exposed to GRN163L.\nWe found that GRN163L is a promising adjuvant treatment in combination with radiation therapy that may improve the therapeutic index by enhancing the radiation sensitivity.

In this study, we examined the effect of Stat3 on Survivin expression in irradiated HUVECs and breast cancer cells. We also studied how inhibition of Stat3 and Survivin activity affects cell survival and angiogenesis following irradiation. We determined that Survivin was significantly increased by overexpression of an active Stat3 (Stat3-C). Following irradiation, the level of phospho-Stat3 Tyr(705), but not phospho-Stat3 Ser(727), was reduced in HUVECs, whereas it remained unchanged in irradiated breast cancer cells. Correspondingly, Stat3 DNA-binding activity following irradiation was specifically down-regulated in HUVECs but not in breast cancer cells. Mutation of Tyr(705) abolished radiation-induced down-regulation of Survivin. Clonogenic and endothelial cell morphogenesis assays suggested that DN-Stat3 and DN-Survivin together resulted in the greatest radiosensitization of MDA-MB-231, decreasing angiogenesis and cell survival.

{"title": "Hsp90: a novel target for cancer therapy.", "abstract": "Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone required for the stress-survival response, protein refolding, and the conformational maturation of a variety of signaling proteins. Natural products that bind selectively to Hsp90 and inhibit its function have been used to determine its biologic role. Experiments with these drugs have shown that Hsp90 is required for maintaining the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Studies in vivo show that Hsp90 inhibitors have antitumor activity when given alone and in combination with cytotoxics. The basis for the therapeutic index (selective toxicity to cancer cells) of Hsp90 inhibitors is complex and may have to do with induction of degradation of mutant oncoproteins and other proteins necessary for their proliferation and survival as well as to an enhanced requirement of these cells for Hsp90 stress-survival functions. Based on these data, 17-AAG, an ansamycin antibiotic inhibitor of Hsp90, is being tested extensively in clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. These trials demonstrate that the biologic function of Hsp90 can be inhibited in patients and antitumor activity has been noted in patients with breast cancer, multiple myeloma and other cancers. These data and the physicochemical properties of 17-AAG that limit its use as a drug, have led to broad efforts to develop improved and novel Hsp90 inhibitors.

Postoperative radiotherapy is conventionally delivered with conventional wedged tangential fields. However, intensity modulation in radiotherapy helps to maximize tumor control while minimizing damage to normal tissues. This study was to evaluate the potential dosimetric benefits and optimal indications of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for the intact breast.\nTen patients with stage Tis-2N0M0 breast cancer, who received breast-conserving surgery, were selected for this study. A dosimetric comparison of forward planning IMRT with conventional wedged tangential technique was performed on each patient using three-dimensional treatment planning. The total prescribed dose for both plans was 5000 cGy/25 fractions. Dose volume histograms (DVH) were used to compare the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risks (OARs) such as ipsilateral lung, contralateral breast, contralateral lung for all patients, and coronary arteries, heart for left sided patients, and liver for right sided patients.\nThe PTV coverage in IMRT plan was similar to that of the conventional plan (97.7% vs. 98.3%). A better dose uniformity throughout the whole breast was achieved by IMRT plan. The percentage of PTV receiving less than 95% prescribed dose and more than 103% prescribed dose (inhomogeneity index, IHI) decreased from 29.9% to 2.9%; the percentage of PTV receiving more than 105% prescribed dose (V105%) decreased from 28.2% to 0.6%. A better amelioration of IHI and reduction of V105% in IMRT plans were observed in the relatively large PTV subgroup. Obvious reduction in the doses to OARs was achieved by IMRT plan.

BRCC36, one of the proteins in BRCC, directly interacts with BRCA1, and regulates the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of BRCC. Importantly, BRCC36 is aberrantly expressed in the vast majority of breast tumors, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of this disease. To further elucidate the functional consequence of abnormal BRCC36 expression in breast cancer, we have done in vivo silencing studies using small interfering RNAs targeting BRCC36 in breast cancer cell lines, i.e., MCF-7, ZR-75-1, and T47D. Knock-down of BRCC36 alone does not affect cell growth, but when combined with ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, it leads to an increase in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis when compared with the small interfering RNA control group in breast cancer cells. Immunoblot analysis shows that inhibition of BRCC36 has no effect on the activation of ATM, expression of p21 and p53, or BRCA1-BARD1 interaction following IR exposure. Importantly, BRCC36 depletion disrupts IR-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1. Immunofluorescent staining of BRCA1 and gamma-H2AX indicates that BRCC36 depletion prevents the formation of BRCA1 nuclear foci in response to DNA damage in breast cancer cells. These results show that down-regulation of BRCC36 expression impairs the DNA repair pathway activated in response to IR by inhibiting BRCA1 activation, thereby sensitizing breast cancer cells to IR-induced apoptosis.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2006-05-19", "authors": ["XiaoweiChen", "Cletus AArciero", "ChunrongWang", "DominiqueBroccoli", "Andrew KGodwin"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4194"}

The effects of R115777, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, were investigated in cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of growth factor receptors and with differing ras status. Effects on tumour xenografts and human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast in a xenograft mouse model were also tested.\nIn vitro, the concentrations required to reduce cell numbers by 50% (50% inhibitory concentration) were established (MDA-MB231, MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2-18, BT-474, SK-BR3 and SKOV3). Human DCIS was implanted in nude mice or, in separate experiments, cultured cells were injected (MDA-MB231, MCF-7/HER2-18, SKOV3) and allowed to form tumours. Proliferation and apoptosis were determined by immunohistochemistry in xenografts and cell tumours.\nThe 50% inhibitory concentrations varied a hundred-fold, from 39 nmol/l (+/- 26 nmol/l) for SKBR3 to 5.9 micromol/l(+/- 0.8 micromol/l) for MDA-MB231. In MCF-7/HER2-18 and SKOV3 cells the levels of tumour growth inhibition were approximately 85% and 40%, respectively. There was a significant decrease in the cell turnover index (CTI; proliferation/apoptosis). In MDA-MB 231 with activated k-ras no inhibition was observed. In treated DCIS xenografts proliferation decreased and apoptosis increased. The CTI ratio between the start and 1 and 2 weeks of treatment were 1.99 and 1.50, respectively, for controls and 0.85 (P = 0.005) and 0.75 (P = 0.08) for treated xenografts.\nTreatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor reduced cell growth in vitro and cell tumour growth in vivo.

{"title": "A neural network based method for optical patient set-up registration in breast radiotherapy.", "abstract": "Patient set-up optimization is required in breast-cancer radiotherapy to fill the accuracy gap between personalized treatment planning and uncertainties in the irradiation set-up. Opto-electronic systems allow implementing automatic procedures to minimize the positional mismatches of light-reflecting markers located on the patient surface with respect to a corresponding reference configuration. The same systems are used to detect the position of the irradiated body surface by means of laser spots; patient set-up is then corrected by matching the control points onto a CT based reference model through surface registration algorithms. In this paper, a non-deterministic approach based on Artificial Neural Networks is proposed for the automatic, real-time verification of geometrical set-up of breast irradiation. Unlike iterative surface registration methods, no passive fiducials are used and true real-time performance is obtained. Moreover, the non-deterministic modeling performed by the neural algorithm minimizes sensitivity to intra-fractional and inter-fractional non-rigid motion of the breast. The technique was validated through simulated activities by using reference CT data acquired on four subjects. Results show that the procedure is able to detect and reduce simulated set-up errors and revealed high reliability in patient position correction, even when the surface deformation is included in testing conditions.", "journal": "Annals of biomedical engineering", "date": "2006-02-24", "authors": ["IFrosio", "MSpadea", "EDe Momi", "MRiboldi", "GBaroni", "GFerrigno", "ROrecchia", "APedotti"], "doi": "10.1007/s10439-005-9069-1"}

Lymphoscintigraphy was performed with injection of radioactivity isotope (99m)Tc-labeled dextran ((99m)Tc-DX) into the uterine cervix 16 h before surgery. Methylthioninium (4 ml) was injected into the same points as (99m)Tc-DX during surgery, and the patients underwent lymphatic mapping with a handheld gamma-detecting probe. After resection of SLNs, standard radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection was performed. All removed lymph nodes, including the SLNs, were examined by routine histopathology. The histopathologic results of SLNs and non-SLNs were compared.\nThe detection rates of SLN were 96.3% by blue dye method, and 100% by radiolabeled tracer or combined isotope-dye. Blue dye method identified 61 SLNs, radiolabeled tracer identified 69 SLNs, and combined isotope-dye identified 70 SLNs. Preoperative SPECT/CT fusion images detected 4 SLNs in the parametrium.

{"title": "Image-guided radiosurgery in the treatment of spinal metastases.", "abstract": "The authors describe a new method for treating metastatic spinal tumors in which noninvasive, image-guided, frameless stereotactic radiosurgery is performed. Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation in a single or limited number of fractions to a lesion while maintaining delivery of a low dose to adjacent normal structures.\nImage-guided radiosurgery was developed by coupling an orthogonal pair of real-time x-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator that guides the radiation beam to treatment sites associated with radiographic landmarks. This procedure can be conducted in an outpatient setting without the use of framebased skeletal fixation. The system relies on skeletal landmarks or implanted fiducial markers to locate treatment targets. Four patients with spinal metastases underwent radiosurgery with total prescription doses of 1000 to 1600 cGy in one or two fractions. Alignment of the treatment dose with the target volume was accurate to within 1.5 mm. During the course of each treatment fraction, patient movement was less than 0.5 mm on average. Dosimetry was highly conformal, with a demonstrated ability to deliver 1600 cGy to the perimeter of an irregular target volume while keeping exposure to the cord itself below 800 cGy.\nThese experiences indicate that frameless radiosurgery is a viable therapeutic option for metastatic spine disease.", "journal": "Neurosurgical focus", "date": "2006-02-09", "authors": ["M JMurphy", "SChang", "IGibbs", "Q TLe", "DMartin", "DKim"], "doi": "10.3171/foc.2001.11.6.7"}

{"title": "Trends in endocrine therapy and chemotherapy for early breast cancer: a focus on the premenopausal patient.", "abstract": "The majority of breast cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, and treatment is focused on cure and prolonging disease-free survival. Local therapy (surgery and/or radiation treatment) is standard, along with systemic adjuvant therapy that may effectively prevent or delay relapse and death in early-stage disease. In premenopausal women, adjuvant therapeutic approaches include combination cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) was the established chemotherapy regimen; however, newer regimens have more recently been introduced that may offer some benefit over CMF including anthracycline-containing regimens [e.g. cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CEF)], and taxane-containing regimens. For women with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease, a second option is endocrine therapy that aims to suppress mitogenic oestrogen signalling. Until recently, 5 years of tamoxifen was regarded as the standard adjuvant endocrine treatment in ER-positive disease. Ovarian ablation is also effective in premenopausal women, and can be achieved by surgery, radiotherapy, or via the use of a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue such as goserelin. Combining tamoxifen and goserelin treatment provides more effective oestrogen blockade than either drug alone. However, as the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have demonstrated improved efficacy over tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early and advanced disease, combination treatment with goserelin plus an AI may provide optimal oestrogen blockade in premenopausal patients.\nThis review assesses the relative merits of chemotherapeutic and endocrine approaches for the treatment of early breast cancer, and summarises relevant ongoing clinical trials, with an emphasis on the premenopausal setting.", "journal": "Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology", "date": "2006-01-26", "authors": ["WJonat", "K IPritchard", "RSainsbury", "J GKlijn"], "doi": "10.1007/s00432-006-0082-z"}
{"title": "[Factors influencing clinical target volume delineation of intact breast in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for breast cancer].", "abstract": "In patients with breast cancer who underwent breast conservation treatment, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been approved to hold better dosimetric advantages and improbable future. Target delineation is the most important process, which determines the accuracy of planning and application of IMRT. However, there is no consensus criterion for the delineation of clinical target volume (CTV) of intact breast. This study was to investigate the factors influencing the delineation of CTV of intact breast in IMRT for breast cancer.\nThe CTV of intact breast in 6 patients was delineated by 4 radiation oncologists and 1 radiologist individually, and reference CTV was determined by group consensus. The extent of variation in CTV delineation was quantified by the ratio of common volumes (Vco) of all CTVs to the maximum volume encompassing all CTVs (Vmax). The deviation in the extent of CTV from the extent of reference CTV was quantified in each orthogonal direction to find the origins of variations. In addition, all central lung distances (CLD) in tangential fields, which were designed based on CTVs, were measured.\nThe ratios of Vco to Vmax were low (0.660 and 0.651, respectively) in 2 patients with low glandular density. Among the other 4 patients with high glandular density, the ratio was relatively higher in 2 patients with radio-opaque marks than in the other 2 patients with no marks (0.799, 0.769 vs. 0.735, 0.752, respectively). Compared with reference CTVs, the patients' average deviations of the extent of CTVs were 0 in anterior direction, (1.2+/-3.4) mm in posterior direction, (1.5+/-2.1) mm in cranial direction, (0.7+/-4.1) mm in caudal direction, (0.6+/-3.3) mm in medial direction, and (0.8+/-0.8) mm in lateral direction. The most obvious variations were observed in the area of breast axillary part and primary tumor bed after surgery. The mean CLD in 4 patients exceeded over the conventional limitation of 2 cm.\nThe variability between CTVs of intact breast delineated by different radiation oncologists is strongly related to individual glandular density, the extent of breast axillary part, the primary tumor bed after surgery, and the different understanding for lung sparing limitations.", "journal": "Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer", "date": "2006-01-13", "authors": ["Xiao-BoHuang", "Jia-YiChen", "Guo-LiangJiang"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Rapamycin-sensitive pathway regulates mitochondrial membrane potential, autophagy, and survival in irradiated MCF-7 cells.", "abstract": "Radiation-induced inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive pathway and its effect on the cellular response to radiation were studied in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Both radiation and rapamycin shared molecular targets and induced similar physiologic responses. Each of these treatments increased immunostaining of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the nucleus, and radiation led to decreased phosphorylation of its autophosphorylation site Ser2481. In addition to dephosphorylation of established mTOR downstream effectors 4E-binding protein 1 and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, both treatments decreased the level of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. Experiments with the potentiometric dye, JC-1, revealed an oligomycin-dependent increase in mitochondrial membrane potential following radiation or rapamycin treatment, suggesting that both lead to reversal of F0F1ATPase activity. Both radiation and rapamycin induced sequestration of cytoplasmic material in autophagic vacuoles. In both cases, appearance of autophagic vacuoles involved the participation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Transient cotransfection of green fluorescent protein-LC3 with either wild-type or dominant-negative mTOR further showed that inactivation of mTOR pathway is sufficient to induce autophagy in these cells. Finally, administration of rapamycin in combination with radiation led to enhanced mitochondria hyperpolarization, p53 phosphorylation, and increased cell death. Taken together, these experiments show that radiation-induced inhibition of rapamycin-sensitive pathway in MCF-7 cells causes changes in mitochondria metabolism, development of autophagy, and an overall decrease in cell survival.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2005-12-03", "authors": ["ShoshanaPaglin", "Na-YoungLee", "CharlesNakar", "MeganFitzgerald", "JasonPlotkin", "BethanneDeuel", "NadiaHackett", "MelissaMcMahill", "EleanaSphicas", "NinaLampen", "JoachimYahalom"], "doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1083"}

Trials are already in progress to investigate the potential of bevacizumab in indications including metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer, breast and ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab offers the potential to increase survival without substantially altering the toxicity profile in these tumor types. Bevacizumab has shown activity in patients with refractory metastatic RCC, where progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in patients treated with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) than those treated with placebo (hazard ratio=2.55, p<0.001). In addition, combining bevacizumab with erlotinib (Tarceva) has shown a median time to progression of more than 11 months. In NSCLC, a phase II trial revealed that adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy increased therapeutic benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. Adverse events were mild and easily managed, but six patients receiving bevacizumab developed severe hemoptysis. Entry criteria for NSCLC trials have been adjusted to exclude patients with squamous cell histology to try to avoid this issue. Adding bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) to the current standard of care, gemcitabine, in stage IV pancreatic cancer has also shown promising efficacy. Partial responses were seen in 19% of patients, with a further 48% having stable disease. Several ongoing clinical trials are also studying bevacizumab with various chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens. Bevacizumab combined with carboplatin (Paraplatin)/paclitaxel (Taxol) was further examined in a phase III randomized trial that accrued 878 patients with advanced non-squamous cell NSCLC. Patients given chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) plus bevacizumab had a higher response rate, longer PFS and an increase in survival compared with patients on chemotherapy alone. Both regimens were generally well tolerated. Bevacizumab has also shown activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Surgery is the only effective treatment known as these tumors are notorious refractory to all types of conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. To identify a target for therapy, we want to determine whether estrogen signaling is active in chondrosarcoma because estrogen is important in the regulation of longitudinal growth that is initiated by chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the epiphyseal growth plate of long bones.\nWe studied protein expression of the estrogen receptor in 35 cartilaginous tumors as well as mRNA levels for the estrogen receptor and for aromatase, an enzyme for estrogen synthesis and another potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, the activity of aromatase was determined in vitro by the tritiated water release assay. Dose-response experiments with chondrosarcoma cultured cells were done with estrogen, androstenedione, and exemestane.\nAll chondrosarcomas tested showed mRNA and nuclear protein expression of the estrogen receptor. Also, aromatase mRNA was detected. The aromatase activity assay showed a functional aromatase enzyme in primary chondrosarcoma cultures and in a cell line. Growth of chondrosarcoma cell cultures can be stimulated by adding estrogen or androstenedione, which can be inhibited by exemestane.\nThese results show, on the RNA, protein, and cell biological levels, that the ligand and the receptor are active in estrogen-mediated signal transduction.

Three-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images of the rigid rod simulating the needle inserted into the tissue-mimicking agar and chicken breast phantoms were obtained to test the accuracy of the algorithm under ideal conditions. Because the robot possesses high positioning and angulation accuracies, we used the robot as a \"gold standard,\" and compared the results of algorithm segmentation to the values measured by the robot. Our testing results showed that the accuracy of the needle segmentation algorithm depends on the needle insertion distance into the 3D TRUS image and the angulations with respect to the TRUS transducer, e.g., at a 10 degrees insertion anglulation in agar phantoms, the error of the algorithm in determining the needle tip position was less than 1 mm when the insertion distance was greater than 15 mm. Near real-time needle tracking was achieved by scanning a small volume containing the needle. Our tests also showed that, the segmentation time was less than 60 ms, and the scanning time was less than 1.2 s, when the insertion distance into the 3D TRUS image was less than 55 mm.

All patients underwent kyphoplasty that involved the percutaneous transpedicular technique. Fiducial markers allowing for image guidance during CyberKnife treatment were placed, at time of the kyphoplasty, in the pedicles at adjacent levels. Patients underwent single-fraction radiosurgery (mean time after kyphoplasty 12 days) in an outpatient setting. The tumor dose was maintained at 16 to 20 Gy (mean 18 Gy) to the 80% isodose line. The treated tumor volume ranged from 12.7 to 37.1 cm3. No acute radiation-induced toxicity or new neurological deficit occurred during the follow-up period (range 11-24 months, median 16 months). Axial pain improved in 24 (92%) of 26 patients.\nThe combined kyphoplasty and spinal radiosurgery treatment paradigm was found to be clinically effective in patients with pathological fractures; there was no significant spinal canal compromise. In this technique two minimally invasive surgical procedures are combined to avoid the morbidity associated with open surgery while providing both immediate fracture fixation and administering a single-fraction tumoricidal radiation dose.", "journal": "Journal of neurosurgery.

{"title": "Mechanisms of disease: Radiosensitization by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.", "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are among the most intensely studied new molecular therapeutic agents. Although response rates have been somewhat disappointing when EGFR inhibitors are used as single-agent therapy for advanced disease, these inhibitors may be more effective as chemo- and radiosensitizers. The first phase III randomized trial evaluating EGFR inhibitors as radiosensitizers in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer was strongly positive, indicating significant potential of this class of agents to improve outcome with radiotherapy. However, optimal implementation of EGFR inhibitors as radiosensitizers depends, in part, on a better understanding of the mechanisms of radiosensitization. Preclinical studies provide important observations with regard to potential mechanisms. The phenotypic cellular changes associated with EGFR inhibition are impressively consistent between different model systems, with almost all studies showing that EGFR inhibitors affect proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell survival. Whether EGFR inhibitors influence response to radiation directly, or whether the improved response is a result of additive effects of the two modalities, remains unclear. However, cell-cycle arrest, endothelial cell sensitivity, and apoptotic potential are all important factors in radiation response of epithelial tumors. Furthermore, less-studied effects of EGFR inhibitors on DNA repair suggest that modulation of DNA damage response to cytotoxic injury might result in radio- or chemosensitization. This review will explore potential mechanisms of radiosensitization by EGFR inhibitors.", "journal": "Nature clinical practice.

{"title": "Gefitinib: current and future status in cancer therapy.", "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is recognized as a key modulator of tumor cell function and is considered to be a viable drug target in a range of solid malignancies. Current knowledge of its role in tumor growth and progression has led to a newly active area of anticancer research, investigating agents that target the activity of this receptor. Of these agents, gefitinib is furthest in clinical development, having received regulatory approval in Japan in 2002, and in the United States and Australia in 2003. Gefitinib is an orally active, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells and other host-dependent processes promoting cancer cell growth. A plethora of preclinical studies have suggested promising outcomes for this agent and have led to ongoing clinical trials in a wide range of tumors, including non-small-cell lung, head and neck, colorectal, prostate, and breast, either as monotherapy or in combination with standard chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiotherapy. Furthermore, as biologic agents are specifically designed to attack different pathways of tumor growth and progression, the potential for the combination of gefitinib with other agents, given either concurrently or sequentially, to prevent or delay disease recurrence is also being investigated. This article provides a detailed overview of gefitinib, the rationale for its use in a wide range of tumor types, and the current clinical development status of this novel agent.", "journal": "Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O", "date": "2005-11-01", "authors": ["Roy SHerbst", "Merrill SKies"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Respiratory motion prediction by using the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).", "abstract": "The quality of radiation therapy delivered for treating cancer patients is related to set-up errors and organ motion. Due to the margins needed to ensure adequate target coverage, many breast cancer patients have been shown to develop late side effects such as pneumonitis and cardiac damage. Breathing-adapted radiation therapy offers the potential for precise radiation dose delivery to a moving target and thereby reduces the side effects substantially. However, the basic requirement for breathing-adapted radiation therapy is to track and predict the target as precisely as possible. Recent studies have addressed the problem of organ motion prediction by using different methods including artificial neural network and model based approaches. In this study, we propose to use a hybrid intelligent system called ANFIS (the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) for predicting respiratory motion in breast cancer patients. In ANFIS, we combine both the learning capabilities of a neural network and reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic in order to give enhanced prediction capabilities, as compared to using a single methodology alone. After training ANFIS and checking for prediction accuracy on 11 breast cancer patients, it was found that the RMSE (root-mean-square error) can be reduced to sub-millimetre accuracy over a period of 20 s provided the patient is assisted with coaching. The average RMSE for the un-coached patients was 35% of the respiratory amplitude and for the coached patients 6% of the respiratory amplitude.", "journal": "Physics in medicine and biology", "date": "2005-09-24", "authors": ["ManishKakar", "H\u00e5kanNystr\u00f6m", "Lasse RyeAarup", "Trine JakobiN\u00f8ttrup", "Dag RuneOlsen"], "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/50/19/020"}
{"title": "Mechanisms and treatment for bone metastases.", "abstract": "Alterations in bone architecture and mineral metabolism are common complications of malignancy. Cancers such as breast, prostate, and lung can affect the skeleton either indirectly through the elaboration of factors that act to disrupt normal calcium homeostasis at the level of the kidney and bone; or directly via secondary spread of tumor to bone. Although the pathophysiology of these skeletal complications is diverse, it is clear that the osteoclast and osteoblast are not just bystanders but are active participants in the development and progression of hypercalcemia and bone metastasis. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of metastasis leading to tumor cell escape, homing, adhesion, and secondary growth in a hospitable environment are evolving. Treatment modalities aimed at not only reducing tumor burden but altering the skeletal response to tumor have shown benefit. Newer generation bisphosphonates are quite effective in controlling hypercalcemia of malignancy and have been shown to delay progression of skeletal metastases. Clearly, cancer-associated bone morbidity remains a major public health problem. To improve therapy and prevention it is important to understand the pathophysiology of the effects of cancer on bone.

A voxel-by-voxel analysis was performed to produce parametric spatial pharmacokinetic parametric maps and histograms. Histogram segmentation was used to quantify the heterogeneity in tumor response to therapy, and compared with conventional descriptive measures of distribution in terms of their capacity to separate control from AG-treated tumors.\nThe albumin-(Gd-DTPA)30 endothelial transfer constant, Kps, showed changes with AG-013736 treatment and tumor growth. The changes were highly heterogeneous for individual segments of the histogram with different Kps values, and the overall patterns in which the frequency distribution changed differed significantly between the two groups. A change in the number of voxels with Kps ranging from 0.03 to 0.14 mL/min/(100 mL tissue) was the most sensitive variable for separating control from AG-treated tumors (P = 0.0008). Parametric maps of the kinetic parameters also showed spatial heterogeneity in tumor response to treatment. The Kps maps depicted rapid development of central necrosis as a result of AG-013736 treatment. Maps of v(p) demonstrated a marked increase at peripheral regions of necrotic areas.

Previous studies implicate an autocrine loop caused by high expression of PDGF and its receptor, PDGFR, in the proliferation of some glioblastomas. Here, we demonstrate that pretreatment of a human glioblastoma cell line, RuSi RS1, with imatinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation. This effect was not seen in human breast cancer (BT20) and colon cancer (WiDr) cell lines. Whereas c-Abl and c-Kit were expressed about equally in the three cell lines, RuSi RS1 cells showed significantly higher expression of PDGFR-beta protein in comparison to BT20 and WiDr. Imatinib treatment of RuSi RS1 cells decreased overall levels of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and specifically inhibited phosphorylation of PDGFR-beta, while c-Abl was not prominently activated in these cells.

Therefore, we have investigated the effects of the orally bioavailable Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) on the radiosensitivity of human tumor cells in vitro and grown as tumor xenografts.\nThe effect of 17-DMAG on the levels of three proteins (Raf-1, ErbB2, and Akt) previously implicated in the regulation of radiosensitivity was determined in three human solid tumor cell lines. A clonogenic assay was then used to evaluate cell survival after exposure to 17-DMAG followed by irradiation. For mechanistic insight, the G(2)- and S-phase checkpoints were evaluated in 17-DMAG-treated cells. Finally, the effect of in vivo administration of 17-DMAG in combination with radiation on the growth rate of xenograft tumors was determined.\n17-DMAG exposure reduced the levels of the three radiosensitivity-associated proteins in a cell line-specific manner with ErbB2 being the most susceptible. Corresponding concentrations of 17-DMAG enhanced the radiosensitivity of each of the tumor cell lines. This sensitization seemed to be the result of a 17-DMAG-mediated abrogation of the G(2)- and S-phase cell cycle checkpoints. The oral administration of 17-DMAG to mice bearing tumor xenografts followed by irradiation resulted in a greater than additive increase in tumor growth delay.\nThese data indicate that 17-DMAG enhances the in vitro and in vivo radiosensitivity of human tumor cells.

We used stable RNAi to reduce expression of CXCR4 in murine 4T1 cells, a highly metastatic mammary cancer cell line that is a model for stage IV human breast cancer. Using noninvasive bioluminescence and magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that knockdown of CXCR4 significantly limited the growth of orthotopically transplanted breast cancer cells. Mice in which parental 4T1 cells were implanted had progressively enlarging tumors that spontaneously metastasized, and these animals all died from metastatic disease. Remarkably, RNAi of CXCR4 prevented primary tumor formation in some mice, and all mice transplanted with CXCR RNAi cells survived without developing macroscopic metastases. To analyze effects of CXCR4 on metastases to the lung, an organ commonly affected by metastatic breast cancer, we injected tumor cells intravenously and monitored cell growth with bioluminescence imaging. Inhibiting CXCR4 with RNAi, or the specific antagonist AMD3100, substantially delayed the growth of 4T1 cells in the lung, although neither RNAi nor AMD3100 prolonged overall survival in mice with experimental lung metastases.

MCF+FIR cells also demonstrated increased activity of NF-kappaB, increased expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme (MnSOD), and increased expression of a cell cycle regulatory protein (Cyclin B1). The present studies were designed to determine the relationship of NF-kappaB, MnSOD and Cyclin B1 expression in cellular adaptive responses to ionizing radiation.\nThe first intron of the cyclin B1 gene with a putative NF-kappaB element was cloned into the pGL3 luciferase reporter (pGL3CB1EI1). PGL3CB1EI1 and control NF-kappaB luciferase activities were determined in MCF-7 and MCF+FIR cells treated with a single dose of radiation, over expression of the dominant negative mutant IkB (mIkB) or over expression of the SOD2 gene.\nMCF+FIR cells derived from fractionated IR demonstrated increased transactivation of the pGL3CB1EI1 and NF-kappaB controlled reporter activities, relative to the parental cell line. Transfection of dominant negative mutant IkB that inhibits NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, inhibited pGL3CB1EI1 and NF-kappaB activity, indicating the NF-kappaB dependence of pGL3CB1EI1 mediated transcription. In addition, over expression of the human SOD2 gene (MnSOD) inhibited NF-kappaB and pGL3CB1EI1 activity, indicating that superoxide or some species derived from superoxide may have participated in the up-regulation of reporter activity in response to chronic exposure to fractionated ionizing radiation.

Pathological causes of gynecomastia include organic diseases and therapy, such as the administration of estrogens and antiandrogens, which alter the ratio of circulating hormones. Hormone therapy for prostate cancer is generally well tolerated but often accompanied by the occurrence of gynecomastia and breast pain or tenderness. The increased use of antiandrogens as monotherapy is leading to an increase in the number of patients affected by gynecomastia. Treatments are available to alleviate or prevent the development of gynecomastia, including medical treatment with antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors. Alternatively, mastectomy with excision of the gland, liposuction or an association of the two techniques have proved to be effective. Radiation therapy may provide effective relief from the breast pain associated with gynecomastia. In this paper we show the good results of mastectomy performed with a lower semicircular periareolar incision in men suffering from gynecomastia due to antiandrogen therapy for inoperable prostate cancer. In addition, we present a review of the various techniques used for the treatment of gynecomastia.\nDuring the period from September 1998 to May 2001, 10 patients receiving hormone treatment for metastatic or inoperable prostatic cancer were selected for the study if they had breast pain and bilateral gynecomastia. Five of these patients had been offered prophylactic radiotherapy before treatment but refused, while the remaining five patients had refused radiotherapy after hormone treatment. These patients were therefore given the option of surgical treatment. Before surgery all patients underwent clinical and ultrasound examination of the breast. All surgical samples were examined histopathologically. During follow-up clinical examinations were carried out one week, one month, six months, one year and two years after surgery.\nThe results were satisfactory in all patients especially from an aesthetic point of view. Moreover, breast pain disappeared about one week after surgery. After a follow-up of 6-36 months (average, 22.8 months) no recurrences were observed. Only a few immediate postoperative complications were recorded (hematoma in one case and seroma in another). Histological examination of the excised glands showed fibrosclerotic tissue and a small amount of fat.\nSurgical liposuction can be considered an effective treatment for gynecomastia, in particular in the very early stages because the breast becomes irreversibly fibrous as the disease progresses. This surgical technique is simple and effective and is therefore to be considered favorable, especially because of the very short hospitalization and the absence of complications.", "journal": "Tumori", "date": "2004-10-30", "authors": ["DomenicoPrezioso", "GiuseppePiccirillo", "RaffaeleGalasso", "VincenzoAltieri", "VincenzoMirone", "TullioLotti"], "doi": "10.1177/030089160409000409"}
{"title": "Endocrine therapy for early breast cancer.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer has had a major impact on mortality in clinical trials, and the observation that breast cancer mortality started to decline shortly after widespread tamoxifen prescription was introduced in several countries inevitably leads us to conclude that this intervention is responsible. Aromatase inhibitor therapy will undoubtedly become part of everyday practice in the future, although the optimization of aromatase inhibitor therapy as part of the overall endocrine package needs further definition. However, to suppose that a unified optimal sequence and duration is applicable to all patients is probably a fallacy, and underlying the overall effects of different treatments are individual patients with individual but potentially classifiable tumors requiring different management strategies. Characterization and individualization of therapies based on gene and proteomic expression profiling is a massive research undertaking, but could guide us towards a fairly simple set of key gene or protein expression profiles to guide adjuvant hormonal, chemotherapeutic or new biologic agent strategies that will define optimal treatment packages for women with early breast cancer. Within the next 5 years, the clinical reservations regarding adjuvant aromatase inhibitors and financial obstacles to access the aromatase inhibitors are likely to be overcome and, unless we are able to identify a cohort of women who will gain no additional benefit or who have a better outcome with tamoxifen, most postmenopausal women will be treated with aromatase inhibitor monotherapy or a sequential combination utilizing an aromatase inhibitor.", "journal": "Expert review of anticancer therapy", "date": "2004-10-16", "authors": ["Syed AHussain", "SarahWilliams", "AndreaStevens", "Daniel WRea"], "doi": "10.1586/14737140.4.5.877"}

{"title": "Using a Bayesian network to predict the probability and type of breast cancer represented by microcalcifications on mammography.", "abstract": "Since the widespread adoption of mammographic screening in the 1980's there has been a significant increase in the detection and biopsy of both benign and malignant microcalcifications. Though current practice standards recommend that the positive predictive value (PPV) of breast biopsy should be in the range of 25-40%, there exists significant variability in practice. Microcalcifications, if malignant, can represent either a non-invasive or an invasive form of breast cancer. The distinction is critical because distinct surgical therapies are indicated. Unfortunately, this information is not always available at the time of surgery due to limited sampling at image-guided biopsy. For these reasons we conducted an experiment to determine whether a previously created Bayesian network for mammography could predict the significance of microcalcifications. In this experiment we aim to test whether the system is able to perform two related tasks in this domain: 1) to predict the likelihood that microcalcifications are malignant and 2) to predict the likelihood that a malignancy is invasive to help guide the choice of appropriate surgical therapy.", "journal": "Studies in health technology and informatics", "date": "2004-09-14", "authors": ["Elizabeth SBurnside", "Daniel LRubin", "Ross DShachter"], "doi": null}

In addition, the experimental examination showed the inhibitory effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on hematogenous metastasis of colon cancer. The mechanism of the COX-2 inhibitor remains unclear.

{"title": "Discovery of potent antagonists of the antiapoptotic protein XIAP for the treatment of cancer.", "abstract": "Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are overexpressed in many cancers and have been implicated in tumor growth, pathogenesis, and resistance to chemo- or radiotherapy. On the basis of the NMR structure of a SMAC peptide complexed with the BIR3 domain of X-linked IAP (XIAP), a novel series of XIAP antagonists was discovered. The most potent compounds in this series bind to the baculovirus IAP repeat 3 (BIR3) domain of XIAP with single-digit nanomolar affinity and promote cell death in several human cancer cell lines. In a MDA-MB-231 breast cancer mouse xenograft model, these XIAP antagonists inhibited the growth of tumors. Close structural analogues that showed only weak binding to the XIAP-BIR3 domain were inactive in the cellular assays and showed only marginal in vivo activity. Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which ligands for the BIR3 domain of XIAP induce apoptosis by freeing up caspases.

Fuzzy logic provides a formal framework for constructing systems exhibiting both good numeric performance (accuracy) and linguistic representation (interpretability). However, fuzzy modeling--meaning the construction of fuzzy systems--is an arduous task, demanding the identification of many parameters. To solve it, we use evolutionary computation techniques (specifically cooperative coevolution), which are widely used to search for adequate solutions in complex spaces. We have successfully applied the algorithm to model the decision processes involved in two breast cancer diagnostic problems, the WBCD problem and the Catalonia mammography interpretation problem, obtaining systems both of high performance and high interpretability.

This is mainly due to the so-called minimal residual disease, i.e., remaining tumor cells that overcome surgery and/or radiotherapy and are the cause of locoregional and distant metastases. To metastasize, tumor cells take advantage of proteases to invade and remodel surrounding tissues. Here, we analyzed the efficiency of WX-UK1, a novel 3-amidinophenylalanine-based inhibitor of the uPA system, at inhibiting the invasive capacity of carcinoma cells. First, uPAR expression was characterized in different carcinoma cell lines, including SCCHN, breast and cervical carcinoma. Thereafter, the invasive potential of these cell lines was determined using Matrigel invasion chambers and a spheroid cocultivation model with human fibroblasts. uPAR expression levels correlated positively with invasion capacity, which could be significantly inhibited by WX-UK1. A decrease of tumor cell invasion by up to 50% was achieved in both models with the SCCHN line FaDu and the cervical carcinoma line HeLa after treatment with WX-UK1. Thus, our results demonstrate the potential of WX-UK1 in vitro as a promising adjuvant antimetastatic therapy of carcinomas.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "2004-06-02", "authors": ["SunaErtongur", "StephanLang", "BrigitteMack", "KatjaWosikowski", "BerndMuehlenweg", "OlivierGires"], "doi": "10.1002/ijc.20192"}

COX-2 protein expression is increased in many tumors including those of the breast. COX-2-derived PGs have been shown to protect cells from radiation damage. This study evaluated the role of COX-2-derived PG in radiation treatment by using the NMF11.2 mammary tumor cell line originally obtained from HER-2/neu mice that overexpress HER-2/neu. We determined whether the effects of the COX-2 inhibitor SC236 on cell growth, radiation-induced PGE2 production and COX expression, cell cycle redistribution, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were acting through COX-2-dependent mechanisms. The NMF11.2 cells expressed both COX-1 and COX-2 protein and mRNA. The radiation treatment alone led to a dose-dependent increase in the levels of COX-2 mRNA and COX-2 protein, which was associated with an increase in the production of PGE2 and prostacyclin (PGI2). Treating NMF11.2 cells with high concentrations (20 microM) of SC236 for 48 h reduced the radiation-induced increase in COX-2 activity and also decreased cell growth. SC236 (20 microM) increased the accumulation of the cells in the radiosensitive G2-M phase of the cell cycle. However, a low concentration (5 microM) of SC236 was adequate to reduce COX-2 activity. The lower concentration of SC236 (5 microM) also decreased cell growth after a longer incubation period (96 h) and, in combination with a 2 or 5 Gy dose, led to an accumulation of cells in G2-M phase. Restoring PG to control values in cells treated with 5 microM SC236 prevented the growth inhibition and G2-M cell cycle arrest. Radiation treatment of NMF11.2 cells also increased VEGF protein expression and VEGF secretion in a dose-dependent manner, which was blocked in those cells pretreated with 20 microM SC236 but not in those pretreated with 5 microM SC236. These findings indicate that the COX-2 inhibitor SC236 reduced cell growth and arrested cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle by mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of PG production while its effects on VEGF appear to be independent of COX-2.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2004-04-14", "authors": ["SusanLanza-Jacoby", "Adam PDicker", "SheldonMiller", "Francis ERosato", "John TFlynn", "Stephanie NLavorgna", "RandyBurd"], "doi": "10.4161/cbt.3.4.803"}

Ionizing radiation may enhance the apoptosis inducing potential of TRAIL in sensitive cells, and sensitize TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. We assessed the influence of sequential treatment of irradiation followed by TRAIL on intracellular mechanisms of apoptosis of breast tumor cells in vitro and on tumor regression in xenografted athymic nude mice. Irradiation augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells through up-regulation of DR5, and subsequent activation of caspases-3, -8 and -9. Inhibition of p53 by siRNA abrogated irradiation-induced DR5 expression, suggesting the requirement of p53 for DR5 induction. The pretreatment of cells with irradiation followed by TRAIL significantly induced more apoptosis than single agent alone or concurrent treatment with irradiation and TRAIL. The sequential treatment of xenografted mice with irradiation followed by TRAIL-induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation, completely eradicated the established breast tumors, and enhanced survival of mice without detectable toxicity to normal tissues. The sequential treatment with irradiation followed by TRAIL provides an approach to enhance therapeutic potential of TRAIL.

{"title": "[Radiotherapy and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor: preclinical findings and preliminary clinical trials].", "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that ionizing radiation activate existing cellular response pathways involving protein kinases. These pathways mediate the cytotoxic and cytoprotective responses of cell death and cell survival, respectively. Cytoprotective responses involve dominantly mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) through radiation-induced activation of EGF receptors and may stimulate cell proliferation if radiation-induced damage is successfully repaired. Similarly, overexpression of EGF receptor family members or their activation by ligands expressed at normal levels may also confer radioresistance. Recent encouraging results indicate that EGF receptor inhibitors such as antibodies or small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors may be effective radiosensitizers in tumors. Within the antibody class of EGF receptor inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and trastuzumab. These agents have a common target of the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor. Striking synergistic antitumor effects on human epidermoid and on adenocarcinoma cancer-cell xenografts have been observed when cetuximab treatment is combined with radiotherapy. Promising results have also been obtained from the first clinical trial with cetuximab and radiotherapy in squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Trastuzumab has been poorly studied in combination with radiotherapy but showed an increased radiosensitivity of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells as measured by in vitro colony-forming assays. The mechanism of radiosensitization appears to involve DNA repair. There are well over a dozen agents in the small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor category but the preclinical studies in combination with radiotherapy exist only for ZD1839 and CI1033. Preliminary studies confirm the capacity of ZD1839 and radiotherapy to produce a highly significant increase in tumor growth inhibition when compared to treatment with either modality alone. Another member of the quinazoline class of small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (CI1033) has recently been examined for its impact in conjunction with radiation in a series of HER-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. This molecule inhibits tyrosine-kinase activity in all four members of the HER family, and preclinical studies showed a synergistic interaction of CI1033 with ionizing radiation.

To gauge the potential clinical utility of targeting both EGFR and HER2 to control growth and radiosensitize human breast cancers, we examined the effect of a dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, GW572016, on the proliferation and radiation response of either EGFR- or HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines.\nPrimary human breast cancer cell lines that endogenously overexpress EGFR or HER2 and luminal mammary epithelial H16N2 cells stably transfected with HER2 were evaluated for the effect of GW572016 on inhibition of ligand-induced or constitutive receptor phosphorylation, proliferation, radiosensitization, and inhibition of downstream signaling.\nGW572016 inhibited constitutive and/or ligand-induced EGFR or HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation of all five cell lines, which correlated with the antiproliferative response in all but one cell line. GW572016 radiosensitized EGFR-overexpressing cell lines, but HER2-overexpressing cells were unable to form colonies after brief exposure to GW572016 even in the absence of radiation, and thus could not be evaluated for radiosensitization. One cell line was resistant to the antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of GW572016, despite receptor inhibition. Exploration of potential mechanisms of resistance in SUM185 cells revealed failure of GW572016 to inhibit downstream ERK and Akt activation, despite inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation. In contrast, sensitive HER2-overexpressing cell lines demonstrated inhibition of both ERK and Akt phosphorylation.\nGW572016 potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation in either EGFR- or HER2-overexpressing cell lines and has both antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects. Resistance to GW572016 was not due to a lack of receptor inhibition, but rather with a lack of inhibition of ERK and Akt, suggesting that measurement of inhibition of crucial signaling pathways may better predict response than inhibition of receptor phosphorylation.

This is a simple, reliable, inexpensive examination, allowing to identify a grave and frequent pathology, but that can be the object of an effective treatment if early detected. The recognition of the microcalcifications in the mammographies is the key for early detection of cancers. Automatic detection methods were already proposed, but they have a very weak specificity and a relatively low sensibility. Currently, the eye of the expert still remains the better judge. We propose a neuromimetic method to localize automatically the microcalcifications. In this method, we devise a network of formal neurones inspired from the mammal retina architecture. This model mimics one characteristic of the retina which is is a sensor that automatically adapts to the image characteristics to analyse and realize the outlines extraction and adaptative filtering of the pictures, based on its network properties. The results were tested using a public standardized data set (DDSM), which was designed to test the automatic detection methods.

In the current study, we evaluated the effect of targeting HER2 on radiosensitization of human breast cancer cells. Using six breast cancer cell lines with various levels of HER2 (BT474, SKBR3, MDA453, MCF7, ZR75B, and MDA468), we found that trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody that may inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation but does not induce apoptosis when used alone, enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis of the cells in a HER2 level-dependent manner. We furthered this study in MCF7 cells transfected for high levels of HER2 (MCF7HER2). Compared with parental or control vector-transfected MCF7 cells, MCF7HER2 cells showed increased phosphorylation of at least two important HER2 downstream molecules, protein kinase B/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and increased resistance to radiotherapy, as shown by reduced induction of apoptosis and increased cell clonogenic survival after radiation. Exposure of the cells to trastuzumab down-regulated the levels of HER2 and reduced phosphorylation levels of Akt and MAPK in MCF7HER2 cells, and sensitized these cells to radiotherapy. When specific inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and MAPK kinase (MEK) pathways were used, we found that exposure of MCF7HER2 cells to the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited Akt phosphorylation and radiosensitized the cells, whereas the radiosensitization effect by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was relatively weaker, albeit the phosphorylation of MAPK was reduced by PD98059 treatment. Our results indicate that the PI3-K pathway might be the major pathway for trastuzumab-mediated radiosensitization of breast cancer cells.", "journal": "Molecular cancer therapeutics", "date": "2003-11-18", "authors": ["KeLiang", "YangLu", "WeidongJin", "K KianAng", "LukaMilas", "ZhenFan"], "doi": null}

Consequently, bisphosphonates have become an integral part of the management of bone metastases from breast cancer. Improved understanding of the biology of osteoclastogenesis led to the identification of osteoprotegerin as a critical modulator of osteoclast activity.

We subsequently investigated the extent to which ZD1839 might improve radiation therapy (RT) in similar animal models of human cancer within the limits of tolerance at a relevant organ site.\nWe carried out studies of ZD1839 in in vivo models of human non-small cell lung (A549 and SK-LC-16) and breast (MDA-MB468) cancers and human mesothelioma (JMN). The tumors were implanted s.c. over the rib cage or on the most proximate breast and RT given ventral dorsally to the chest only, with mediastinal protection. After the tumor reached a palpable size (0.4-0.6 mm), treatment was initiated with the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ZD1839 (150 mg/kg once daily x 5 for 2 successive weeks), RT (a total of 40 Gy given fractionally at 4 Gy once daily x 5 for 2 successive weeks), or both ZD1839 and RT.\nThis level of RT induced no untoward effects in the mice and was effective (18-72%) in bringing about regression of the tumors with a few complete regressions. ZD1839 alone, given p.o. on the same schedule at its MTD (150 mg/kg), was modestly inhibitory (35-40%) to tumor growth.

{"title": "Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor signaling: early results and future trends in oncology.", "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of a family of membrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity, is emerging as a target candidate for anti-cancer therapy, due to its overexpression in many carcinomas and its relationship with several hallmark properties of malignant behavior such as continuous cell proliferation, escape from apoptosis, cell migration and angiogenesis. Specially appealing is the overexpression of EGFR in tumors such as lung, colon, kidney and head and neck carcinomas which are mostly resistant to current chemotherapy. Several anti-EGFR agents are already in clinical testing: small molecule tyrosine kinases inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies and cancer vaccines. Early results provide evidence of antitumor activity in humans, to be confirmed in larger trials. Toxicity profiles do not overlap with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but skin rash and diarrhea can be severe. Future investigations should clarify optimal schedules and explore combinations with standard onco-specific treatments. The ultimate challenge will be to combine diverse therapeutic interventions dealing with a regulatory system which is complex, highly redundant and robust.

Cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are two key enzymes in the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2. Radiation induces the overproduction of cytokines and chemokines, and it also increases PGE2 production, both locally and systemically. In this study, we tested the effects of a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) after 50 Gy radiation of MCa-35 tumor and cutaneous tissues of C3H/He mice. Preclinical toxicity endpoints and associated alterations in chemokine production and cellular infiltrates were measured. Celecoxib was given by daily gavage (50 mg/kg for 15 days), with the first dose delivered either 2 hours before, 2 days after, or 7 days after a single dose of radiation. Celecoxib-treated animals had less inflammation of the dermis compared with saline-treated controls. Severe skin dermatitis occurred in 23.8% (5/21) of mice treated with 50 Gy, whereas only 17.6%, 5.3%, and 11.1% of mice in the 2-hour pre-, or the 2-day post-, and 7-day postirradiation groups, respectively, had severe dermatitis on day 20. The decreased skin toxicity scores were associated with a reduction of both blood vessels and focal necrosis in MCa-35 tumors. Celecoxib also significantly decreased C-C family chemokine (Rantes and MCP-1) mRNA expression in irradiated skin tissues, but not in tumor tissues, which was accompanied by a decrease in skin mRNA expression of both C-C (CCR2 and CCR5) and C-X-C (CXCR2 and CXCR4) chemokine receptors. A significant positive correlation was also found between skin damage (skin scores) and chemokine and its receptor mRNA expression in radiation-treated mice. Finally, celecoxib also decreased the infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils in locally irradiated tumor and surrounding normal tissue. The differential effects of celecoxib on inflammation help to explain the selective protection by celecoxib of irradiated cutaneous tissues without a concurrent protection of MCa-35 tumors.", "journal": "American journal of clinical oncology", "date": "2003-08-07", "authors": ["LiLiang", "DongpingHu", "WeiminLiu", "Jacqueline PWilliams", "PaulOkunieff", "IvanDing"], "doi": "10.1097/01.COC.0000074149.95710.40"}

Murine mammary tumor line (MCa-35) and human lung carcinoma line (A549) have high and low basal levels of COX-2 protein, respectively. Treatment of both tumor cells with celecoxib alone resulted in a dose- and time-dependent reduction of cell number (clonogenic cell death) and tumor cell growth rate in vitro; however, inhibition of tumor cell growth by celecoxib was not correlated with the reduction of COX-2 protein in tumor cells. Although both tumor cell types had similar DNA damage after celecoxib treatment, significant induction of tumor cell apoptosis was only observed in MCa-35. Celecoxib-mediated radiation sensitization also occurred in MCa-35 cells determined by clonogenic assay, in part due to a G2/M arrest at 8 to 24 hours after treatment. The tumor growth inhibitory effects of celecoxib were also studied in vivo. It was found that celecoxib inhibited both tumor growth after intragastric administration of celecoxib (5 daily doses of 50 mg/kg). Combined with a single 30-Gy dose of radiation, celecoxib resulted in additive effects on A549 tumors. Celecoxib-treated A549 tumors had marginal reduction of total and perfused blood vessels compared with untreated controls. Reduction of tumor angiogenic cytokine and growth factor mRNA was associated with decreased perfused vessels. Finally, reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor protein after celecoxib was also observed in both tumor lines by Western blot.

{"title": "Enhancement of radiation response by roscovitine in human breast carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.", "abstract": "Frequent deregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activation associated with loss of cell cycle control was found in most of human cancers. A recent development of a new class of antineoplasic agents targeting the cell cycle emerged as a small molecule CDK inhibitor, roscovitine, which presents potential antiproliferative and antitumoral effects in human tumors. Additional studies reported that roscovitine combined with cytotoxic agents can cooperate with DNA damage to activate p53 protein. However, little is known about the biological effect of roscovitine combined with ionizing radiation (IR) in human carcinoma, and no studies were reported thus far in p53 mutated carcinoma. In the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231, which lacks a functional p53 protein, we found a strong radiosensitization effect of roscovitine in vitro by clonogenic survival assay and in vivo in MDA-MB 231 xenograft model. Using Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis, a strong impairment in DNA-double-strand break rejoining was observed after roscovitine and IR treatment as compared with IR alone. Cell cycle analysis showed a G(2) delay and no increase in radiation-induced apoptosis in the cells treated with IR or roscovitine and IR. On the other hand, we found a significant induction in micronuclei frequency after roscovitine and IR treatment as compared with IR alone. This effect was also observed in BALB murine cells in contrast to SCID murine cells, which are deficient in DNA-PKcs, suggesting a possible DNA-double-strand break repair defect in the nonhomologous end joining pathways. In MDA-MB 231 cells, the radiosensitization effect of roscovitine was associated with an inhibition of the DNA-dependent protein kinase activity caused by a marked decrease in Ku-DNA binding by using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In conclusion, we found a novel effect on DNA repair of the CDK inhibitor roscovitine, which acts as a radiosensitizer in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer cells lacking a functional p53.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2003-05-17", "authors": ["LaurenceMaggiorella", "EricDeutsch", "Val\u00e9rieFrascogna", "NicoleChavaudra", "LaurenceJeanson", "FabienMilliat", "Fran\u00e7oisEschwege", "JeanBourhis"], "doi": null}

Despite the enormous effort put into cancer prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, it is likely that the incidence of the cancer morbidity and mortality will increase for the foreseeable future. This is due to various factors such as increased life expectancy, changes in environment and also the socio-economic situation around the world. Some cancer attracts more attention than others and increasingly epidemiological information is reaching the general public and is beginning to influence behavior. It is now well recognized that, for example, 1 of 8 women in the industrialized world will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Additionally, a strong correlation was established between lung cancer incidence and smoking and it is broadly accepted that the incidence of colon cancer is directly related to age and diet, and has been increasing over time. The current failure of preventive measures to significantly reduce the increasing incidence of these common tumors illustrates the importance of effective cancer treatment strategies, including chemotherapy. The combination of various anticancer drugs, given together with surgery and radiotherapy, gives hope to many patients. There has been recent evidence of improved therapeutic outcome with recent approaches and newer agents but for continuing effective chemotherapeutic treatment there is a need for a detailed understanding of their mechanisms of action and on the rationale of their application. This review attempts to provide up-to-date information regarding the development of new and innovative treatment strategies for cancer chemotherapy.

Since (99m)Tc-MIBI accumulates within mitochondria, which also play a central role in apoptosis through the integration of death signals by Bcl-2 family members, we tested whether early (99m)Tc-MIBI uptake is affected by alterations of the apoptotic pathway. Forty-two breast cancer patients were intravenously injected with 740 MBq of (99m)Tc-MIBI and planar images were obtained 10 min post injection with the patients in the prone lateral position. Ten carcinomas failed to accumulate (99m)Tc-MIBI and could not be visualised on scintigraphic images despite being larger than 1.8 cm (MIBI negative). Thirty-two of the 42 breast carcinomas showed focal uptake of (99m)Tc-MIBI (MIBI positive), and 10 min tumour-to-background ratios (T/B) varied between 1.14 and 6.93. The apoptotic index, the rate of proliferation, and the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and pro-apoptotic Bax protein were assessed in surgically excised tumours. All MIBI-negative carcinomas showed a dramatic and statistically significant reduction in the apoptotic index as compared with MIBI-positive lesions (mean+/-SD, 0.14+/-0.15 vs 1.28+/-0.83, P<0.0001) independently of rate of proliferation, tumour size and P-glycoprotein expression. Significantly higher levels of Bcl-2 were also found in MIBI-negative as compared with MIBI-positive carcinomas. In MIBI-positive lesions, an inverse significant correlation was found between T/B ratios and Bcl-2 levels ( r=-0.50, P<0.01). Our findings indicate that early uptake of (99m)Tc-MIBI in breast carcinomas is affected by alterations of apoptotic pathway. High levels of Bcl-2, despite the stabilisation of mitochondrial membrane potentials, prevent accumulation of (99m)Tc-MIBI in tumour cells.

In preclinical studies of cell lines and human tumor xenografts, ZD1839 as single-agent therapy produced growth inhibition in a wide variety of common solid tumor types including lung, prostate, breast, colon, and ovarian cancers. In these models, ZD1839 inhibited growth of tumor xenografts with high, moderate, and low expression of EGFR. The A431 vulvar carcinoma model, which expresses abnormally high levels of EGFR, was particularly sensitive to ZD1839 treatment, leading to tumor regression. When ZD1839 was coadministered with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy, additive or even synergistic antitumor activity was achieved. The inhibition observed with ZD1839 treatment was not restricted to advanced metastatic tumors, but also extended to early lesions such as breast xenografts of human ductal carcinoma in situ. Inhibition of EGFR-TK has also been shown to delay the onset of tumor development in a transgenic animal model.

Since many tumor cells exhibit the EGFR on their surface, functional imaging of EGFR provides not only a non-invasive, reproducible, quantifiable alternative to biopsies, but it also greatly complements pharmacokinetic studies by correlating clinical responses with biological effects. Moreover, molecular endpoints of anti-EGFR therapy could be assessed effectively. C225 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the human extracellular EGFR and inhibits the growth of EGFR-expressing tumor cells. Also, it has been demonstrated that C225, in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy, is effective in eradicating well-established tumors in nude mice.

{"title": "A targeted inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase sensitizes breast cancer cells following ionizing radiation.", "abstract": "A major mechanism by which cancer cells become resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy drugs is by enhanced DNA repair of the lesions; therefore, through inhibition of DNA repair pathways that tumor cells rely on to escape chemotherapy, we expect to increase the killing of cancer cells and reduce drug resistance. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase essential for DNA repair as well as sensing and transmitting a damage signal to downstream targets leading to cell cycle arrest. We used a peptide cotherapy strategy to see whether a targeted inhibition of DNA-PK activity sensitizes breast cancer cells in response to IR or chemotherapy drug. A synthesized peptide representing the C terminus of Ku80 (HNI-38) selectively targeted and disrupted interaction between Ku complex and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) as well as the DNA binding activity of Ku that led to the inhibition of DNA-PK activity and reduction in double-stranded DNA break (dsb) repair activity. Furthermore, a peptide-based inhibitor with target sequence effectively inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells only in the presence of DNA damage, suggesting that the target peptide sensitizes cancer cells through blocking dsb DNA repair activity. Together, this study not only validates the involvement of the C terminus of Ku80 in Ku's DNA termini binding and interaction with DNA-PKcs, but also a supports physiological role for DNA-PK in IR or chemotherapy drug resistance of cancer cells.", "journal": "The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics", "date": "2002-10-22", "authors": ["Chung-HuiKim", "Su-JungPark", "Suk-HeeLee"], "doi": "10.1124/jpet.102.038505"}

We tested the antiproliferative and the proapoptotic activity of ZD1839 in combination with ionizing radiation in human colon (GEO), ovarian (OVCAR-3), non-small cell lung (A549 and Calu-6), and breast (MCF-7 ADR) cancer cell lines. The antitumor activity of this combination was also tested in nude mice bearing established GEO colon cancer xenografts.\nWith ionizing radiation or ZD1839, a dose-dependent growth inhibition was observed in all of the cancer cell lines growing in soft agar. A cooperative antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect was obtained when cancer cells were treated with ionizing radiation followed by ZD1839. This effect was accompanied by inhibition in the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins bcl-xL and bcl-2, and by a suppression of the activated (phosphorylated) form of akt protein. Treatment of mice bearing established human GEO colon cancer xenografts with radiotherapy (RT) resulted in a dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition that was reversible upon treatment cessation. Long term GEO tumor growth regressions were obtained after RT in combination with ZD1839. This resulted in a significant improvement in survival of these mice as compared with the control group (P < 0.001), the RT-treated group (P < 0.001), or the ZD1839-treated group (P < 0.001). The only mice alive 10 weeks after tumor cell injection were in the RT-plus-ZD1839 group. Furthermore, 10% of mice in this group were alive and tumor-free after 26 weeks. Similar results were obtained in mice bearing established human A549 lung adenocarcinoma xenografts. Finally, the combined treatment with RT plus ZD1839 was accompanied by a significant potentiation in the inhibition of transforming growth factor alpha, vascular epidermal growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor expression in cancer cells, which resulted in significant antiangiogenic effects as determined by immunohistochemical count of neovessels within the GEO tumors.\nThis study provides a rationale for evaluating in cancer patients the combination of ionizing radiation and selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as ZD1839.", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "date": "2002-10-11", "authors": ["CataldoBianco", "GiampaoloTortora", "RobertoBianco", "RobertaCaputo", "Bianca MariaVeneziani", "RosaCaputo", "VincenzoDamiano", "TeresaTroiani", "GabriellaFontanini", "DavidRaben", "StefanoPepe", "A RaffaeleBianco", "FortunatoCiardiello"], "doi": null}

{"title": "The citrus methoxyflavone tangeretin affects human cell-cell interactions.", "abstract": "Two effects of the citrus methoxyflavone tangeretin on cell-cell interactions are biologically relevant. Firstly, tangeretin upregulates the function of the E-cadherin/catenin complex in human MCF-7/6 breast carcinoma cells. This leads to firm cell-cell adhesion and inhibition of invasion in vitro. Secondly, tangeretin downregulates the interleukin-2 receptor on T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells. This leads to a decrease in the cytotoxic competence of these immunocytes against cancer cells. The second effect can become important when high doses of tangeretin are combined with adjuvant tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer. Experiments with nude mice bearing MCF-7/6 tumors showed that tangeretin given orally at high doses, abrogated the therapeutic suppression of tumor growth exerted by tamoxifen. No evidence for a tumor promoting effect of tangeretin by itself was found in these experiments.

The purpose of the algorithm is to produce compensation for tangential breast radiotherapy in order to improve dose homogeneity. This was achieved by creating intensity-modulated fields to supplement standard wedged fields. Portal image data were used to create thickness maps of the medial and lateral fields, which in turn were used to design the wedged and intensity-modulated fields. The ANNs were developed to design the intensity-modulated fields from the portal image data and corresponding fluence map alone. One used localized groups of portal image pixels related to the fluence map (method 2), and the other used a one-to-one mapping between spatially corresponding pixels (method 3). A dosimetric comparison of the methods was performed by calculating the overall dose distribution. The volume of tissue outside the dose range 95-105% was used to assess dose homogeneity. The average volume outside 95-105%, averaged over 80 cases, was shown to be 2.3% for the algorithm, whilst average values of 9.9% and 13.5% were obtained for methods 2 and 3, respectively.

A well-designed randomised controlled trial has shown that expressive support psychosocial therapy does not improve survival of women with MBC. Her2 overexpression seems to be a significant predictor of response to taxanes and anthracyclines, and FISH testing for Her2 seems to be superior to IHC in predicting response to Herceptin. Recent evidence confirms the independent prognostic value of VEGF, UPA and PAI-1 in women with early breast cancer and suggests that such parameters may have a role in selecting systemic therapy.

{"title": "E1A inhibition of radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity through suppression of IKK activity and IkappaB degradation, independent of Akt activation.", "abstract": "Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been implicated in the protection of cells from apoptosis. We have shown previously that the adenovirus type 5 E1A sensitizes cells to radiation-induced apoptosis by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity. However, the exact mechanism of inhibition is not known. In this study, we compared the activity of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase (IKK) and the degradation of IkappaBalpha in E1A transfectants and parental human cancer cells after ionizing radiation treatment. We found that radiation-induced IKK activity and IkappaBalpha degradation were inhibited in the E1A transfectants. Recently, Akt has been implicated in NF-kappaB activation. To test whether Akt is regulated by E1A and is involved in radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity, we examined the phosphorylation status of Akt in the E1A transfectants and parental cells and in irradiated cells. The results indicated that radiation induced Akt phosphorylation and that E1A inhibited basal but not radiation-induced Akt phosphorylation. We additionally examined radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity in cells stably transfected with a dominant-negative, inactive Akt and in parental cancer cells treated with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. We found that dominant-negative Akt and wortmannin did not block radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity. Thus, our results suggest that inhibition of IKK activity and IkappaB degradation is the predominant mechanism for E1A-mediated inhibition of radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity and that radiation-induced Akt activation cannot be inhibited by E1A and is likely independent of radiation-induced NF-kappaB activity.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "2001-10-19", "authors": ["RShao", "E MTsai", "KWei", "Rvon Lindern", "Y HChen", "KMakino", "M CHung"], "doi": null}

Artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) models were developed and compared with the surgeon's clinical impression. The first 490 patients were used as the training set for each model. The ANN and LR were tested on the remaining patients, who were divided into 2 consecutive groups. The main outcome measures were (1) the accuracy (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve analysis) of biopsy recommendations based on the surgeon's impression and created by the 2 models and (2) the percentage of cancers that were falsely categorized as benign by the surgeon or the 2 models.\nDespite the fact that the surgeon's clinical impression showed good discrimination (area under ROC = 0.86), 13 of 708 cases (1.8%) thought to be benign by the surgeon proved to be carcinomas. The neural network (but not the LR model) was statistically superior to the surgeon's impression (ANN: ROC = 0.89, P =.004; LR: ROC = 0.86). Additionally, the computerized models were able to quantitate risk. Those patients predicted to be \"benign\" by the network (n = 391) had only a 0.5% risk of intraductal carcinoma and no invasive carcinoma, whereas 47% of those patients in the highest risk quartile had cancer.

VIP/PACAP receptors have been evaluated in normal and diseased human non-neuronal tissues by using in vitro receptor autoradiography with 125I-VIP or 125I-PACAP in tissue sections. As assessed by subtype-selective VIP analogs, VIP receptors of the VPAC1 subtype are found in a wide variety of tissues including liver, breast, kidney, prostate, ureter, bladder, pancreatic ducts, gastrointestinal mucosa, lung, thyroid, adipose, and lymphoid tissues. VPAC2 receptors are predominantly found in vessels and smooth muscles, whereas PAC1 receptors are present in the adrenal medulla. VIP/PACAP receptors are expressed in the majority of the most frequently occurring human tumors, including breast, prostate, pancreas, lung, colon, stomach, liver, and bladder carcinomas, as well as lymphomas and meningiomas, predominantly as VPAC1 receptors, as do their tissues of origin. Although leiomyomas predominantly express VPAC2 receptors, glial tumors, pituitary adenomas, neuroblastomas, paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, and endometrial carcinomas preferentially express PAC1 receptors. The very wide distribution of VIP/PACAP receptors in the normal human body is indicative of the key role of these peptides in human physiology and pathophysiology.

Treatment parameters pertaining to 150 previously planned patients were used for correlating the midplane breast contour of a new patient with an appropriate set of tangential beam weights and wedge angles; other treatment parameters including, planning target volume and isocenter, were specified by a radiation oncologist. Treatment plans generated by the expert system approach and a traditional, dosimetric approach were compared and rated prospectively in 45 patients. In addition, planning time was measured for both approaches. A performance rating of 97% was achieved for the expert system, in which an artificial neural network was used to correlate breast contours to treatment parameters, and approximately 30 minutes per patient was saved in treatment planning time. This high performance rating validated various assumptions concerning the expert system: namely, that the resultant dose distribution was not influenced by tangential field width (within the range of 7 to 12 cm), nominal beam energy (6 MV), or wedge type (physical vs. enhanced dynamic).

{"title": "Neovascular targeting with cyclic RGD peptide (cRGDf-ACHA) to enhance delivery of radioimmunotherapy.", "abstract": "Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been hampered by delivery of only a small fraction of the administered dose of radiolabeled MAb to tumor. A strategy for creating and controlling tumor vascular permeability would enable more effective RIT. The alpha v beta 3 integrin receptor is an appealing target for strategies designed to enhance permeability of tumor vessels because it is highly and preferentially expressed in most tumors. In human tumor mouse models, apoptosis of neovascular endothelial cells has been demonstrated after treatment with alpha v beta 3 antagonists. Since this apoptotic effect could transiently increase permeability of tumor blood vessels, radiolabeled antibodies (MAb) circulating during this period would have increased access to extravascular tumor. To determine if this hypothesis was correct, a pharmacokinetic study of an immunospecific MAb given after an alpha v beta 3 antagonist was performed in nude mice bearing human breast cancer xenografts. The alpha v beta 3 antagonist, cyclic RGD pentapeptide (c-RGDf-ACHA; cyclo arginine glycine aspartic acid D-phenylalanine -1 amino cyclohexane carboxylic acid), inhibits alpha v beta 3 binding to its vitronectin ligand at nanomolar levels. Cyclic RGD peptide (250 micrograms i.p.) given 1 hour before 111In-ChL6 MAb resulted in a 40-50% increase in tumor uptake (concentration), when compared to the control tumor uptake, of MAb 24 hours after administration. When cyclic RGD peptide was given as a continuous infusion (17.5 micrograms/hr) for 1 or 24 hours before 111In-ChL6, tumor uptake of 111In-ChL6 was increased less, and, these data were not statistically different from the control data. There were no differences for any of the groups in the groups in the concentrations of 111In-ChL6 in normal organs or blood when compared to the control group. The results suggest that cyclic RGD peptide provided a temporary, selective increase in tumor vascular permeability, that allowed a larger fraction of the 111In-ChL6 to accumulate in the tumor.", "journal": "Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals", "date": "2000-03-31", "authors": ["S JDeNardo", "P ABurke", "B RLeigh", "R TO'Donnell", "L AMiers", "L AKroger", "S LGoodman", "SMatzku", "AJonczyk", "K RLamborn", "G LDeNardo"], "doi": "10.1089/cbr.2000.15.71"}

This scheme is no longer sustainable with the large numbers of images available on-line and stringent time constraints. Therefore the objective of this study was to develop, optimize, and evaluate on clinical data an artificial intelligence decision-making tool for portal verification. The tool, based on the artificial neural network (ANN) approach, should approximate, as closely as possible, portal verification assessments made by a radiation oncologist expert.\nA total of 328 electronic portal images of tangential breast irradiations were included in the study. A radiation oncologist expert evaluated these images and rated the treatment set-up acceptability on a scale from 0 to 10. Translational and rotational errors in the placement of the radiation field boundaries formed seven-dimensional feature vectors that represented each of the 328 portal images/treatments. The feature vectors were used as inputs to a three-layer, feedforward ANN. The neural network was trained on the oncologist's ratings.\nThe rms discrepancy between the ANN and the expert's ratings was 1.05 rating points. Using the decision threshold equal to 5 for both sets of ratings, the ANN classifier was capable of detecting 100% of the portals classified as \"unacceptable\" by the expert. Only 6.5% of portals acceptable to the oncologist were misclassified as \"unacceptable\" by the ANN.\nThe results of this study indicate the feasibility of using the ANN portal image classifier as an automated assistant to the radiation oncologist.

Doxycycline induced expression of a dominant negative EGFR-CD533 mutant, lacking the COOH-terminal 533 amino acids, in MDA-TR15-EGFR-CD533 cells was used to characterize intracellular signaling responses following irradiation. Within 10 min, radiation exposure caused an immediate, transient activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) which was completely blocked by expression of EGFR-CD533. The same radiation treatment also induced an immediate activation of the c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) pathway that was followed by an extended rise in kinase activity after 30 min. Expression of EGFR-CD533 did not block the immediate JNK1 response but completely inhibited the later activation. Treatment of MDA-TR15-EGFR-CD533 cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, resulted in approximately 70% inhibition of radiation-induced MAPK activity, and potentiated the radiation-induced increase of immediate JNK1 activation twofold. Inhibition of Ras farnesylation with a concomitant inhibition of Ras function completely blocked radiation-induced MAPK and JNK1 activation. Modulation of EGFR and MAPK functions also altered overall cellular responses of growth and apoptosis. Induction of EGFR-CD533 or treatment with PD98059 caused a 3-5-fold increase in radiation toxicity in a novel repeated radiation exposure growth assay by interfering with cell proliferation and potentiating apoptosis. In summary, this data demonstrates that both MAPK and JNK1 activation in response to radiation occur through EGFR-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and are mediated by signaling through Ras. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that radiation-induced activation of EGFR results in downstream activation of MAPK which may affect the radiosensitivity of carcinoma cells.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "1999-09-01", "authors": ["D BReardon", "J NContessa", "R BMikkelsen", "KValerie", "CAmir", "PDent", "R KSchmidt-Ullrich"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1202849"}

Irradiation (2 Gy) of A431 and MDA-MB-231 cells caused immediate primary activations (0-10 min) of the EGFR and the MAPK and JNK pathways, which were surprisingly followed by later prolonged secondary activations (90-240 min). Primary and secondary activation of the EGFR was abolished by molecular inhibition of EGFR function. The primary and secondary activation of the MAPK pathway was abolished by molecular inhibition of either EGFR or Ras function. In contrast, molecular inhibition of EGFR function abolished the secondary but not the primary activation of the JNK pathway. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor function by use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies blunted primary activation of the JNK pathway. Addition of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody versus transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) had no effect on the primary activation of either the EGFR or the MAPK and JNK pathways after irradiation but abolished the secondary activation of EGFR, MAPK, and JNK. Irradiation of cells increased pro-TGFalpha cleavage 120-180 min after exposure. In agreement with radiation-induced release of a soluble factor, activation of the EGFR and the MAPK and JNK pathways could be induced in nonirradiated cells by the transfer of media from irradiated cells 120 min after irradiation. The ability of the transferred media to cause MAPK and JNK activation was blocked when media were incubated with a neutralizing antibody to TGFalpha. Thus radiation causes primary and secondary activation of the EGFR and the MAPK and JNK pathways in autocrine-regulated carcinoma cells. Secondary activation of the EGFR and the MAPK and JNK pathways is dependent on radiation-induced cleavage and autocrine action of TGFalpha. Neutralization of TGFalpha function by an anti-TGFalpha antibody or inhibition of MAPK function by MEK1/2 inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) radiosensitized A431 and MDA-MB-231 cells after irradiation in apoptosis, 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and clonogenic assays.

To establish a biochemical efficacy end point for overcoming alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT)-mediated tumor cell resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, we performed a novel dose escalation clinical trial for the AGT-depleting agent O6-benzylguanine (BG). The dose of BG required to deplete AGT to undetectable levels (BMD(T)) in sequential computed tomography-guided tumor tissue biopsies before BG and 18 h after BG was determined. Thirty patients received doses of BG ranging from 10 to 120 mg/m2. In tumor tissue, AGT depletion >86% of baseline was demonstrated at all doses tested. Residual tumor AGT activity, present 18 h after BG doses of 10-80 mg/m2, was eliminated at the 120 mg/m2 dose and is thus the BMD(T) of BG. BG pharmacokinetics are characterized by the rapid, dose-independent clearance of BG from plasma Metabolism of BG to its biologically active metabolite, 8-oxo-benzylguanine (8-oxo-BG), was found. The t(1/2) of 8-oxo-BG is longer than BG. Plasma concentrations of 8-oxo-BG well above 200 ng/ml 18 h after the end of the BG infusion were observed at the highest dose levels tested and appeared to correlate with depletion of AGT activity to undetectable levels in tumor tissue. AGT activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at baseline did not correlate with tumor tissue AGT activity. Depletion of AGT activity to undetectable levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurred at lower doses and was not a reliable predictor for tumor tissue depletion.

Targeting the estrogen and progesterone receptors found in receptor-positive breast cancer provides a means of diagnosing the disease non-invasively. The structure-activity relationship of evaluated fluorine-18 ligands are summarized and design considerations for construction of novel target ligands discussed. The role of the serum protein sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in transport and metabolism of estrogens is related to target tissue uptake. A historical review of fluorine-18 radiolabeled estrogens includes the clinical study of 16 alpha-[18F]fluoroestradiol-17 beta (18FES) for imaging ER+ breast lesions. The success of 18FES in the clinical setting has shown the significance of PET in imaging primary and metastatic breast cancer by allowing for assessment of tumor response to tamoxifen therapy after as little as 7 days of treatment. Advantages of visualizing the tumor through targeting the progesterone receptor (PR) include PET imaging to follow the progress of tamoxifen therapy while the estrogen receptors are blocked. Clinical studies with the PR ligand 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone (18FENP) were not successful due to high hepatic uptake and poor correlation of tumor uptake with receptor content.

Women were significantly more likely to adhere to screening guidelines if they reported participating with their doctor in the decision to be screened; were younger; had smaller families, higher education and income, and a recent Pap smear; reported breast problems; and lived in an area with a higher percentage of mammography facilities with reminder systems, no shortage of primary care providers, higher HMO market share, and higher screening charges.\nA small percentage of women adhere to screening guidelines, suggesting that adherence needs to become a focus of clinical, programmatic, and policy efforts.", "journal": "Health services research", "date": "1998-05-05", "authors": ["K APhillips", "KKerlikowske", "L CBaker", "S WChang", "M LBrown"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Aerospace technology transfer to breast cancer imaging.", "abstract": "In the United States in 1996, an estimated 44,560 women died of breast cancer, and 184,300 new cases were diagnosed. Advances in space technology are now making significant improvements in the imaging technologies used in managing this important foe. The first of these spinoffs, a digital spot mammography system used to perform stereotactic fine-needle breast biopsy, uses a backside-thinned CCD developed originally for the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer. This paper describes several successful biomedical applications which have resulted from collaborative technology transfer programs between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health (OWH). These programs have accelerated the introduction of direct digital mammography by two years. In follow-on work, RTI is now assisting the HHS Office on Women's Health to identify additional opportunities for transfer of aerospace, defense, and intelligence technologies to image-guided detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer. The technology identification and evaluation effort culminated in a May 1997 workshop, and the formative technology development partnerships are discussed.", "journal": "Acta astronautica", "date": "1997-08-01", "authors": ["D LWinfield"], "doi": "10.1016/s0094-5765(98)00054-x"}
{"title": "Discrimination of fibroblast subtypes by multivariate analysis of gene expression.", "abstract": "Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts from normal, fibrotic or tumoral breast tissues present multiple quantitative differences in gene expression even when grown in isolation. We were therefore prompted to investigate whether one could recognize various subtypes by their constitutive-gene expression profile. Quantitative autoradiographic data for 34 constitutively expressed transcripts were submitted to multivariate analysis of variance, followed by discriminant analysis and single linkage cluster analysis. Models assuming up to 8 putative fibroblast subtypes (among fibroblasts or myofibroblasts from breast skin, normal mammary stroma, tumor-adjacent \"normal\" stroma, post-radiation fibrosis lesions and benign or malignant tumors) and an epithelial-cell group used as an internal control resulted in 100% correct classification. Myofibroblasts from various origins clustered close to, although distinctly apart from, their corresponding alpha-smooth-muscle-actin-negative counterparts. Malignant tumor fibroblasts were phenotypically more distant from normal cells compared with other pathological types. Our results support the hypothesis of co-adaptive transformation of stromal and epithelial tissues during breast tumoral development and suggest that different types of fibroblasts give rise to different types of myofibroblasts. Discriminant analysis of quantitative molecular variation may be considered for the development of a powerful artificial-intelligence method for cell typing and should be particularly useful when no reliable discrete molecular markers are available.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "date": "1997-05-02", "authors": ["ESpanakis", "DBrouty-Boy\u00e9"], "doi": "10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19970502)71:3<402::aid-ijc17>3.0.co;2-h"}

In a 200 women sample, who had undergone screening for breast cancer with clinical examination and bilateral mammography, we calculated the Composite Risk Factors of six Characteristics (C6RF), which are family history for breast cancer, pregnancy history, menstrual history, history of cystic breast disease, history of regular breast clinical or self-examination and presence or not of breast lump, using an expert system in IBM-compatible personal computer. In these cases the average C6RF was 0.18 (SD +/- 0.19) in low-risk group and 2.61 (SD +/- 4.76) in high-risk group and all cases with C6RF values higher than 0.56 were put in the high-risk group. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of the C6RF method, in discovering breast cancer, was 90% and the specificity 81.5% and the C6RF method was proved to be clinically valuable in identifying the high-risk group and controlling breast cancer.", "journal": "Studies in health technology and informatics", "date": "1996-12-08", "authors": ["L ITsouskas", "ALiaros", "JTzitzikas", "PPantelis", "ACapizzello", "L SPapadopoulos"], "doi": null}
{"title": "Endocrine therapies of breast cancer.", "abstract": "Endocrine therapies for breast cancer have been used for more than a century. The concept that changing the hormonal balance of the patient with breast cancer could lead to changes in tumor growth and regression of metastatic disease was recognized even before hormones and endocrine agents were available. Ablation of ovaries, adrenals, or hypophysis was used in advanced disease to obtain tumor regression and control of symptoms. Ovarian ablation was also tested for operable breast cancer showing a significant beneficial treatment effect. Several endocrine agents have been developed in recent years: estrogens, androgens, progestins, antiestrogens, aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, antiprogestins, and antiandrogens. The use of some of these agents in advanced disease led to investigations in early breast cancer: tamoxifen was the drug which was most extensively tested, showing a significant long-term benefit for treated patients. Progestins (medroxyprogesterone acetate) and aromatase inhibitors (aminoglutethimide) were also tested in a few clinical trials, but no conclusive recommendations for their use in patients with operable disease may be formulated. The most important current challenges for the appropriate use of endocrine therapies in breast cancer include (1) understanding the effect of endocrine therapies and the mechanisms of resistance associated with their use; (2) developing new agents with novel endocrine antitumor effect; (3) defining the best way to combine endocrine agents with cytotoxics or with other endocrine manipulations; and (4) identifying long-term effects of endocrine agents in terms of disease control and prevention, as well as desirable and undesirable side effects.", "journal": "Seminars in oncology", "date": "1996-08-01", "authors": ["AGoldhirsch", "R DGelber"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Ethacrynic acid: a novel radiation enhancer in human carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Because agents that interfere with thiol metabolism and glutathione S-transferase (GST) functions have been shown to enhance antitumor effects of alkylating agents in vitro and in vivo, the present study was conceived on the basis that an inhibitor of GST would enhance the radiation response of some selected human carcinoma cells. Ethacrynic acid (EA) was chosen for the study because it is an effective inhibitor of GST and is a well known diuretic in humans.\nExperiments were carried out with well-established human tumor cells in culture growing in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cell lines used were MCF-7, MCF-7 adriamycin resistant (AR) cells (breast carcinoma), HT-29 cells (colon carcinoma), DU-145 cells (prostate carcinoma), and U-373 cells (malignant glioma). Cell survival following the exposure of cells to drug alone, radiation alone, and a combined treatment was assayed by determining the colony-forming ability of single plated cells in culture to obtain dose-survival curves. The drug enhancement ratio was correlated with levels of GST.\nThe cytotoxicity of EA was most pronounced in MCF-7, U-373, and DU-145 cells compared to MCF-7 AR and HT-29 cells. The levels of GST activity were found to be lower in those EA-sensitive cells. A significant radiation enhancement was obtained with EA-sensitive cells exposed to nontoxic concentrations of the drug immediately before or after irradiation. The sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of MCF-7 cells was 1.55 with EA (20 micrograms/ml), while the SER of MCF-7 AR was less than 1.1. Based on five different human tumor cells, a clear inverse relationship was demonstrated between the magnitude of SER and GST levels of tumor cells prior to the combined treatment.\nThe present results suggest that EA, which acts as both a reversible and irreversible inhibitor of GST activity, could significantly enhance the radiation response of human cancer cells and the level of GST in tumor cells may predict the magnitude of radiation enhancement with EA. Ethacrynic acid would be an excellent drug as a radiosensitizer for further in vivo tumor study.", "journal": "International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics", "date": "1996-01-15", "authors": ["M SKhil", "S HKim", "J TPinto", "J HKim"], "doi": "10.1016/0360-3016(95)02040-3"}
{"title": "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin sensitizes murine fibroblasts and human tumor cells to radiation and blocks induction of p53 following DNA damage.", "abstract": "AT cells are extremely sensitive to ionizing radiation. Since the AT gene has homology to phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases (PI 3-kinases), wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, was used to determine if PI 3-kinase activity regulates radiation sensitivity. Human and murine cells exposed to wortmannin alone did not display significant cytotoxicity. Wortmannin in combination with radiation was an effective radiosensitizer of murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, with a sensitizer enhancement ratio of 1.8 at 10% survival, and had a similar effect on the human tumor cell lines HeLa, SW480, and MCF-7. Wortmannin inhibited the induction of p53 DNA-binding activity by actinomycin D and radiation and blocked the transcriptional activation of a p53 CAT reporter gene by actinomycin D. Wortmannin radiosensitized both wild-type (NIH-3T3 and MCF-7) and mutant (SW480 and HeLa) p53 cells, indicating that p53 induction was not required for radiosensitization by wortmannin. The results suggest that a wortmannin-sensitive pathway, possibly involving PI 3-kinase activity, may regulate the response of the cells to DNA damage.", "journal": "Cancer research", "date": "1996-01-15", "authors": ["B DPrice", "M BYoumell"], "doi": null}

{"title": "Cytotoxicity and manganese superoxide dismutase induction by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and ionizing radiation in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells.", "abstract": "Both tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and ionizing radiation cause active-oxygen radical-mediated cell injuries and cell death. Thus cells treated by both TNF and radiation may suffer greater injuries than cells treated by either agent alone. On the other hand, TNF or radiation treatment can stimulate the expression of a mitochondrial superoxide scavenging enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which can lower the cytotoxic effects of both agents. Thus, the induction of MnSOD by radiation may interfere with the cytotoxic action of TNF and vice versa. We used a human breast tumor cell line, MCF-7, to determine the interaction of TNF and radiation on cytotoxicity and MnSOD expression. TNF was found to be more effective as a cytotoxic agent when used before than after radiation treatment. These observations suggest that radiation induced-MnSOD was more effective in reducing the cytotoxic effect of TNF whereas TNF induction of MnSOD was less effective in counteracting the radiation action. Our results not only underscore the different effects of the treatment order of TNF and radiation, but also point to potential implication in the radiotherapy of breast tumors.", "journal": "Lymphokine and cytokine research", "date": "1993-10-01", "authors": ["P SLin", "K CHo", "S JSung", "STsai"], "doi": null}

Daily administration of 2.5 mg/kg flurbiprofen signficantly reduced the growth of this NC adenocarcinoma transplanted subcutaneously into the right flank of WHT/Ht mice. Histological examination showed that primary tumours excised at 3 weeks from treated mice tended to have a more prominent lymphocytic infiltration. There was a non-significant tendency for mice treated with flurbiprofen alone to survive longer after tumour excision and to develop less local metastases, although scar recurrences seemed unaffected.

Multiple subcutaneous metastatic nodules and enlargement of the liver were present but bone metastases could not be shown. A biopsy from a subcutaneous nodule, taken prior to present treatment, showed 86 fmol estradiol binding sites per mg of cytoplasmic protein with a dissociation constant of the estradiol-estradiol binding protein interaction of 2.8 X 10 -10 M. The patient was treated with 200 mg clomiphene citrate daily. Subjective symptoms improved and a reduction of skin nodule size and of liver enlargement followed. The serum enzymes alkaline phosphatase, nucleotidase, and phosphohexoseisomerase were diminished. A 2nd biopsy taken at Day 26 of treatment with clomiphene citrate showed complete inhibition of labeled estradiol tritiated-E2 uptake by the cytosol protein. This finding is thought to show the absence of free binding sites after clomiphene citrate therapy. Microscopic studies of biopsy material were unchanged. These results are thought to be the first to record human in vivo inhibition of trititated-E2 uptake for EBP by an antiestrogen compound, although similar in vitro observations have been made in human tumor specimens.
